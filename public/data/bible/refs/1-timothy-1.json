In this diversity of true opinions let\nTruth itself beget concord;"," and may our God have mercy upon\nus, that we may use the law lawfully,"," the end of the commandment, pure\ncharity."," And by\nthis if any one asks of me, \u201cWhich of these was the meaning of\nThy servant Moses?\u201d these were not the utterances of my\nconfessions, should I not confess unto Thee, \u201cI know not;\u201d and\nyet I know that those opinions are true, with the exception of\nthose carnal ones concerning which I have spoken what I thought\nwell. However, these words of Thy Book affright not those little\nones of good hope, treating few of high things in a humble fashion,\nand few things in varied ways."," But let all, whom I acknowledge to\nsee and speak the truth in these words, love one another, and\nequally love Thee, our God, fountain of truth,\u2014if we thirst not\nfor vain things, but for it; yea, let us so honour this servant of\nThine, the dispenser of this Scripture, full of Thy Spirit, as to\nbelieve that when Thou revealedst Thyself to him, and he wrote\nthese things, he intended that which in them chiefly excels both\nfor light of truth and fruitfulness of profit."]}]}
