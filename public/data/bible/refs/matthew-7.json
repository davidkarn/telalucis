Which things considered as much as Thou\ngivest, O my God, as much as Thou excitest me to \u201cknock,\u201d and\nas much as Thou openest unto me when I knock,"," two things I find which Thou hast\nmade, not within the compass of time, since neither is co-eternal\nwith Thee. One, which is so formed that, without any failing of\ncontemplation, without any interval of change, although changeable,\nyet not changed, it may fully enjoy Thy eternity and\nunchangeableness; the other, which was so formless, that it had not\nthat by which it could be changed from one form into another,\neither of motion or of repose, whereby it might be subject unto\ntime. But this Thou didst not leave to be formless, since before\nall days, in the beginning Thou createdst heaven and earth,\u2014these\ntwo things of which I spoke. But the earth was invisible and\nwithout form, and darkness was upon the deep."," By which words its shapelessness\nis conveyed unto us, that by degrees those minds may be drawn on\nwhich cannot wholly conceive the privation of all form without\ncoming to nothing,\u2014whence another heaven might be created, and\nanother earth visible and well-formed, and water beautifully\nordered, and whatever besides is, in the formation of this world,\nrecorded to have been, not without days, created; because such\nthings are so that in them the vicissitudes of times may take\nplace, on account of the appointed changes of motions and of\nforms."]}]}
