With such as grant that all these things\nwhich Thy truth indicates to my mind are true, I desire to confer a\nlittle before Thee, O my God. For let those who deny these things\nbark and drown their own voices with their clamour as much as they\nplease; I will endeavour to persuade them to be quiet, and to\nsuffer Thy word to reach them. But should they be unwilling, and\nshould they repel me, I beseech, O my God, that Thou \u201cbe not\nsilent to me.\u201d"," Do Thou speak truly in my heart,\nfor Thou only so speakest, and I will send them away blowing upon\nthe dust from without, and raising it up into their own eyes; and\nwill myself enter into my chamber,"," and sing there unto Thee songs of\nlove,\u2014groaning with groaning unutterable"," in my pilgrimage, and remembering\nJerusalem, with heart raised up towards it,","Jerusalem my country, Jerusalem my mother,\nand Thyself, the Ruler over it, the Enlightener, the Father, the\nGuardian, the Husband, the chaste and strong delight, the solid\njoy, and all good things ineffable, even all at the same time,\nbecause the one supreme and true Good.
