For it is true, O Lord, that Thou hast\nmade heaven and earth; it is also true, that the Beginning is Thy\nWisdom, in Which Thou hast made all things."," It is likewise true, that this\nvisible world hath its own great parts, the heaven and the earth,\nwhich in a short compass comprehends all made and created natures.\nIt is also true, that everything mutable sets before our minds a\ncertain want of form, whereof it taketh a form, or is changed and\nturned. It is true, that that is subject to no times which so\ncleaveth to the changeless form as that, though it be mutable, it\nis not changed. It is true, that the formlessness, which is almost\nnothing, cannot have changes, of times. It is true, that that of\nwhich anything is made may by a certain mode of speech be called by\nthe name of that thing which is made of it; whence that\nformlessness of which heaven and earth were made might it be called\n\u201cheaven and earth.\u201d It is true, that of all things having form,\nnothing is nearer to the formless than the earth and the deep. It\nis true, that not only every created, and formed thing, but also\nwhatever is capable of creation and of form, Thou hast made, \u201cby\nwhom are all things.\u201d"," It is true, that everything that\nis formed from that which is formless was formless before it was\nformed."]}]}
