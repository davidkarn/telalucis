Indeed, all of us who read endeavour to trace out and to\nunderstand that which he whom we read wished to convey; and as we\nbelieve him to speak truly, we dare not suppose that he has spoken\nanything which we either know or suppose to be false. Since,\ntherefore, each person endeavours to understand in the Holy\nScriptures that which the writer understood, what hurt is it if a\nman understand what Thou, the light of all true-speaking minds,\ndost show him to be true although he whom he reads understood not\nthis, seeing that he also understood a Truth, not, however, this\nTruth?"]}]}
