But that heaven of heavens was for Thee, O\nLord; but the earth, which Thou hast given to the sons of men,"," to be seen\nand touched, was not such as now we see and touch. For it was\ninvisible and \u201cwithout form,\u201d"," and there was a deep over which\nthere was not light; or, darkness was over the deep, that is, more\nthan in the deep. For this deep of waters, now visible, has, even\nin its depths, a light suitable to its nature, perceptible in some\nmanner unto fishes and creeping things in the bottom of it. But the\nentire deep was almost nothing, since hitherto it was altogether\nformless; yet there was then that which could be formed. For Thou,\nO Lord, hast made the world of a formless matter, which matter, out\nof nothing, Thou hast made almost nothing, out of which to make\nthose great things which we, sons of men, wonder at. For very\nwonderful is this corporeal heaven, of which firmament, between\nwater and water, the second day after the creation of light, Thou\nsaidst, Let it be made, and it was made."," Which firmament Thou calledst\nheaven, that is, the heaven of this earth and sea, which Thou\nmadest on the third day, by giving a visible shape to the formless\nmatter which Thou madest before all days. For even already hadst\nThou made a heaven before all days, but that was the heaven of this\nheaven; because in the beginning Thou hadst made heaven and earth.\nBut the earth itself which Thou hadst made was formless matter,\nbecause it was invisible and without form, and darkness was upon\nthe deep. Of which invisible and formless earth, of which\nformlessness, of which almost nothing, Thou mightest make all these\nthings of which this changeable world consists, and yet consisteth\nnot; whose very changeableness appears in this, that times can be\nobserved and numbered in it. Because times are made by the changes\nof things, while the shapes, whose matter is the invisible earth\naforesaid, are varied and turned."]}]}
