But where is that\nheaven of heavens,"," O Lord, of which we hear in the\nwords of the Psalm, The heaven of heavens are the Lord\u2019s, but the\nearth hath He given to the children of men?"," Where is the heaven, which we\nbehold not, in comparison of which all this, which we behold, is\nearth? For this corporeal whole, not as a whole everywhere, hath\nthus received its beautiful figure in these lower parts, of which\nthe bottom is our earth; but compared with that heaven of heavens,\neven the heaven of our earth is but earth; yea, each of these great\nbodies is not absurdly called earth, as compared with that, I know\nnot what manner of heaven, which is the Lord\u2019s, not the sons\u2019\nof men."]}]}
