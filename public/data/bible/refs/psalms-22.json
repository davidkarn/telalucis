But which of us, amid so many truths which\noccur to inquirers in these words, understood as they are in\ndifferent ways, shall so discover that one interpretation as to\nconfidently say \u201cthat Moses thought this,\u201d and \u201cthat in that\nnarrative he wished this to be understood,\u201d as confidently as he\nsays \u201cthat this is true,\u201d whether he thought this thing or the\nother? For behold, O my God, I Thy servant, who in this book have\nvowed unto Thee a sacrifice of confession, and beseech Thee that of\nThy mercy I may pay my vows unto Thee,"," behold, can I, as I confidently\nassert that Thou in Thy immutable word hast created all things,\ninvisible and visible, with equal confidence assert that Moses\nmeant nothing else than this when he wrote, \u201cIn the beginning God\ncreated. the heaven and the earth.\u201d"," No. Because it is not as clear to\nme that this was in his mind when he wrote these things, as I see\nit to be certain in Thy truth. For his thoughts might be set upon\nthe very beginning of the creation when he said, \u201cIn the\nbeginning;\u201d and he might wish it to be understood that, in this\nplace, \u201cthe heaven and the earth\u201d were no formed and perfected\nnature, whether spiritual or corporeal, but each of them newly\nbegun, and as yet formless.
