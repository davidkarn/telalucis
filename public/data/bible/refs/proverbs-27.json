For as a fountain in a limited space is\nmore plentiful, and affords supply for more streams over larger\nspaces than any one of those streams which, after a wide interval,\nis derived from the same fountain; so the narrative of Thy\ndispenser, destined to benefit many who were likely to discourse\nthereon, does, from a limited measure of language, overflow into\nstreams of clear truth, whence each one may draw out for himself\nthat truth which he can concerning these subjects,\u2014this one that\ntruth, that one another, by larger circumlocutions of discourse.\nFor some, when they read or hear these words, think that God as a\nman or some mass gifted with immense power, by some new and sudden\nresolve, had, outside itself, as if at distant places, created\nheaven and earth, two great bodies above and below, wherein all\nthings were to be contained. And when they hear, God said, Let it\nbe made, and it was made, they think of words begun and ended,\nsounding in times and passing away, after the departure of which\nthat came into being which was commanded to be; and whatever else\nof the kind their familiarity with the world"," would suggest. In whom, being as\nyet little ones,"," while their weakness by this\nhumble kind of speech is carried on as if in a mother\u2019s bosom,\ntheir faith is healthfully built ","up, by which they have and hold as certain\nthat God made all natures, which in wondrous variety their senses\nperceive on every side. Which words, if any one despising them, as\nif trivial, with proud weakness shall have stretched himself beyond\nhis fostering cradle, he will, alas, fall miserably. Have pity, O\nLord God, lest they who pass by trample on the unfledged bird; and\nsend Thine angel, who may restore it to its nest that it may live\nuntil it can fly."]}]}
