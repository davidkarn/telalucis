Finally, O Lord, who art God, and not flesh and\nblood, if man doth see anything less, ","can anything lie hid from \u201cThy good\nSpirit,\u201d who shall \u201clead me into the land of uprightness,\u201d"," which Thou\nThyself, by those words, wert about to reveal to future readers,\nalthough he through whom they were spoken, amid the many\ninterpretations that might have been found, fixed on but one?\nWhich, if it be so, let that which he thought on be more exalted\nthan the rest. But to us, O Lord, either point out the same, or any\nother true one which may be pleasing unto Thee; so that whether\nThou makest known to us that which Thou didst to that man of Thine,\nor some other by occasion of the same words, yet Thou mayest feed\nus, not error deceive us."," Behold, O Lord my God, how many\nthings we have written concerning a few words,\u2014how many, I\nbeseech Thee!

Permit me, therefore, in these\nmore briefly to confess unto Thee, and to select some one true,\ncertain, and good sense, that Thou shall inspire, although many\nsenses offer themselves, where many, indeed, I may; this being the\nfaith of my confession, that if I should say that which Thy\nminister felt, rightly and profitably, this I should strive for;\nthe which if I shall not attain, yet I may say that which Thy Truth\nwilled through Its words to say unto me, which said also unto him\nwhat It willed."]}]}
