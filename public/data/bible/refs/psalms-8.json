And yet, O my God, Thou exaltation of my\nhumility, and rest of my labour, who hearest my confessions, and\nforgivest my sins, since Thou commandest me that I should love my\nneighbour as myself, I cannot believe that Thou gavest to Moses,\nThy most faithful servant, a less gift than I should wish and\ndesire for myself from Thee, had I been born in his time, and hadst\nThou placed me in that position that through the service of my\nheart and of my tongue those books might be distributed, which so\nlong after were to profit all nations, and through the whole world,\nfrom so great a pinnacle of authority, were to surmount the words\nof all false and proud teachings. I should have wished truly had I\nthen been Moses (for we all come from the same mass; and what is\nman, saving that Thou art mindful of him?","). I should then, had I been at\nthat time what he was, and enjoined by Thee to write the book of\nGenesis, have wished that such a power of expression and such a\nmethod of arrangement should be given me, that they who cannot as\nyet understand how God creates might not reject the words as\nsurpassing their powers; and they who are already able to do this,\nwould find, in what true opinion soever they had by thought arrived\nat, that it was not passed over in the few words of Thy servant;\nand should another man by the light of truth have discovered\nanother, neither should that fail to be found in those same\nwords."]}]}
