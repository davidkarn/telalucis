Again, another of these directs his\nattention to that which is said, \u201cIn the beginning God made the\nheaven and the earth,\u201d and beholdeth Wisdom,\u2014the Beginning,"," because It\nalso speaketh unto us."," Another likewise directs his\nattention to the same words, and by \u201cbeginning\u201d understands the\ncommencement of things created; and receives it thus,\u2014In the\nbeginning He made, as if it were said, He at first made. And among\nthose who understand \u201cIn the beginning\u201d to mean, that \u201cin Thy\nWisdom Thou hast created heaven and earth,\u201d one believes the\nmatter out of which the heaven and earth were to be created to be\nthere called \u201cheaven and earth;\u201d another, that they are natures\nalready formed and distinct; another, one formed nature, and that a\nspiritual, under the name of heaven, the other formless, of\ncorporeal matter, under the name of earth. But they who under the\nname of \u201cheaven and earth\u201d understand matter as yet formless,\nout of which were to be formed heaven and earth, do not themselves\nunderstand it in one manner; but one, that matter out of which the\nintelligible and the sensible creature were to be completed;\nanother, that only out of which this sensible corporeal mass was to\ncome, holding in its vast bosom these visible and prepared natures.\nNor are they who believe that the creatures already set in order\nand arranged are in this place called heaven and earth of one\naccord; but the one, both the invisible and visible; the other, the\nvisible only, in which we admire the luminous heaven and darksome\nearth, and the things that are therein."]}]}
