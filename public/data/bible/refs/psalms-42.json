Whence the soul, whose wandering has been\nmade far away, may understand, if now she thirsts for Thee, if now\nher tears have become bread to her, while it is daily said unto her\n\u201cWhere is thy God?\u201d"," if she now seeketh of Thee one\nthing, and desireth that she may dwell in Thy house all the days of\nher life."," And what\nis her life but Thee? And what are Thy days but Thy eternity, as\nThy years which fail not, because Thou art the same? Hence,\ntherefore, can the soul, which is able, understand how far beyond\nall times Thou art eternal; when Thy house, which has not wandered\nfrom Thee, although it be not co-eternal with Thee, yet by\ncontinually and unfailingly clinging unto Thee, suffers no\nvicissitude of times. This in Thy sight is clear unto me, and may\nit become more and more clear unto me, I beseech Thee; and in this\nmanifestation may I abide more soberly under Thy wings."]}]}
