The good principle they called God, and the evil,\nmatter or Hyle (",{"tag":"i","attrs":null,"content":["Con. Faust."]}," xxi. 1, 2). Faustus, in his\nargument with Augustin, admits that they sometimes called the evil\nnature \u201cGod,\u201d but simply as a conventional usage. Augustin says\nthereon (",{"tag":"i","attrs":null,"content":["ibid"]},". sec. 4): \u201cFaustus glibly defends himself by\nsaying, \u2018We speak not of two gods, but of God and Hyle;\u2019 but\nwhen you ask for the meaning of Hyle, you find that it is in fact\nanother god. If the Manich\u00e6ans gave the name of Hyle, as the\nancients did, to the unformed matter which is susceptible of bodily\nforms, we should not accuse them of making two gods. But it is pure\nfolly and madness to give to matter the power of forming bodies, or\nto deny that what has this power is God.\u201d Augustin alludes in the\nabove passage to the Platonic theory of matter, which, as the late\nDean Mansel has shown us (",{"tag":"i","attrs":null,"content":["Gnostic Heresies, Basilides"]},",\netc.), resulted after his time in Pantheism, and which was entirely\nopposed to the dualism of Manich\u00e6us. It is to this \u201cpower of\nforming bodies\u201d claimed for matter, then, that Augustin alludes\nin our text (sec. 24) as \u201cnot only a substance but real life\nalso.\u201d (2) The human soul the Manich\u00e6ans declared to be of the\nsame nature as God, though not created by Him\u2014it having\noriginated in the intermingling of part of His being with the evil\nprinciple, in the conflict between the kingdoms of light and\ndarkness (",{"tag":"i","attrs":null,"content":["in Ps."]}," cxl. sec. 10). Augustin says to Faustus:\n\u201cYou generally call your soul not a temple, but a part or member\nof God \u201d (",{"tag":"i","attrs":null,"content":["Con. Faust."]}," xx. 15); and thus, \u201cidentifying\nthemselves with the nature and substance of God\u201d (",{"tag":"i","attrs":null,"content":["ibid."]},"\nxii. 13), they did not refer their sin to themselves, but to the\nrace of darkness, and so did not \u201cprevail over their sin.\u201d That\nis, they denied original sin, and asserted that it necessarily\nresulted from the soul\u2019s contact with the body. To this Augustin\nsteadily replied, that as the soul was not of the nature of God,\nbut created by Him and endowed with free will, man was responsible\nfor his transgressions. Again, referring to the ",{"tag":"i","attrs":null,"content":["Confessions"]},",\nwe find Augustin speaking consistently with his then belief, when\nhe says that he had not then learned that the soul was not a\n\u201cchief and unchangeable good\u201d (sec. 24), or that \u201cit was not\nthat nature of truth\u201d (sec. 25); and that when he transgressed\n\u201che accused flesh\u201d rather than himself; and, as a result of his\nManich\u00e6an errors (sec. 26), \u201ccontended that God\u2019s immutable\nsubstance erred of constraint, rather than admit that his mutable\nsubstance had gone astray of free will, and erred as a\npunishment.\u201d"]}]}],"contents":["26.
