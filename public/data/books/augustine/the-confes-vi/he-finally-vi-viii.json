In addition\nto the information on this subject, already given in the note to\nbook vi. sec. 2, above, the following references to it may prove\ninstructive. (1) Justin Martyr, describing the manner of receiving\nconverts into the Church in his day, says (",{"tag":"i","attrs":null,"content":["Apol."]}," i. 61):\n\u201cAs many as are persuaded and believe that what we teach and say\nis true and undertake to be able to live accordingly, are\ninstructed to pray, and to entreat God with fasting for the\nremission of their sins that are past, we praying and fasting with\nthem. Then they are brought by us where there is water, and are\nregenerated in the same manner in which we were ourselves\nregenerated. And this washing is called illumination, because they\nwho learn these things are illuminated in their understandings.\u201d\nAnd again (",{"tag":"i","attrs":null,"content":["ibid."]}," 65): \u201cWe, after we have thus washed him\nwho has been convinced and has assented to our teaching, bring him\nto the place where those who are called brethren are assembled, in\norder that we may offer hearty prayers, in common for ourselves and\nfor the baptized [illuminated] person, and for all others in every\nplace.\u2026Having ended the prayers, we salute one another with a\nkiss. There is then brought to the president of the brethren bread,\nand a cup of wine mixed with water; and he, taking them, gives\npraise and glory to the Father of the universe, through the name of\nthe Son and of the Holy Ghost.\u2026And when the president has given\nthanks, and all the people have expressed their assent, those who\nare called by us deacons give to each of those present, to partake\nof, the bread and wine mixed with water over which the thanksgiving\nwas pronounced, and to those who are absent they carry away a\nportion.\u201d And once more (",{"tag":"i","attrs":null,"content":["ibid."]}," 66): \u201cThis food is called\namong us ",{"tag":"span","attrs":{"lang":"EL","id":"vi.VIII.II-p20.1","class":"Greek"},"content":["\u0395\u1f50\u03c7\u03b1\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u1f77\u03b1"]}," [the\nEucharist], of which no one is allowed to partake but the man who\nbelieves that the things which we teach are true, and who has been\nwashed with the washing that is for the remission of sins, and unto\nregeneration, and who is so living as Christ has enjoined.\u201d (2)\nIn Watts\u2019 translation, we have the following note on this episode\nin our text: \u201cHere be divers particulars of the primitive\nfashion, in this story of Victorinus. First, being converted, he\nwas to take some well-known Christian (who was to be his godfather)\nto go with him to the bishop, who, upon notice of it, admitted him\na ",{"tag":"i","attrs":null,"content":["catechumenus"]},", and gave him those six points of\ncatechistical doctrine mentioned Heb. vi, 1, 2. When the time of\nbaptism drew near, the young Christian came to give in his heathen\nname, which was presently registered, submitting himself to\nexamination. On the eve, was he, in a set form, first, to renounce\nthe devil, and to pronounce, I confess to Thee, O Christ, repeating\nthe Creed with it, in the form here recorded. The time for giving\nin their names must be within the two first weeks in Lent; and the\nsolemn day to renounce upon was Maundy Thursday. So bids the\nCouncil of Laodicea (Can. 45 and 46).\u201d The ",{"tag":"i","attrs":null,"content":["renunciation"]},"\nadverted to by Watts in the above passage may be traced to an early\nperiod in the writings of the Fathers. It is mentioned by\nTertullian, Ambrose, and Jerome, and \u201cin the fourth century,\u201d\nsays Palmer (",{"tag":"i","attrs":null,"content":["Origines Liturgic\u00e6"]},", c. 5, sec. 2, where the\nauthorities will be found), \u201cthe renunciation was made with great\nsolemnity. Cyril of Jerusalem, speaking to those who had been\nrecently baptized, said, \u2018First, you have entered into the\nvestibule of the baptistry, and, standing towards the west, you\nhave heard, and been commanded, and stretch forth your hands, and\nrenounce Satan as if he were present.\u2019 This rite of turning to\nthe west at the renunciation of Satan is also spoken of by Jerome,\nGregory, Nazianzen, and Ambrose; and it was sometimes performed\nwith exsufflations and other external signs of enmity to Satan, and\nrejection of him and his works. To the present day these customs\nremain in the patriarchate of Constantinople, where the candidates\nfor baptism turn to the west to renounce Satan, stretching forth\ntheir hands and using an exsufflation as a sign of enmity against\nhim. And the Monophysites of Antioch and Jerusalem, Alexandria and\nArmenia, also retain the custom of renouncing Satan with faces\nturned to the west.\u201d"]}]},{"tag":"note","attrs":{"place":"end","n":"621","id":"vi.VIII.II-p20.2","anchored":"yes"},"content":[{"tag":"p","attrs":{"shownumber":"no","id":"vi.VIII.II-p21","class":"endnote"},"content":[{"tag":"scripRef","attrs":{"passage":"Ps. 112.10","parsed":"|Ps|112|10|0|0","osisRef":"Bible:Ps.112.10","id":"vi.VIII.II-p21.1"},"content":["Ps. cxii. 10"]},"."]}]},{"tag":"note","attrs":{"place":"end","n":"622","id":"vi.VIII.II-p21.2","anchored":"yes"},"content":[{"tag":"p","attrs":{"shownumber":"no","id":"vi.VIII.II-p22","class":"endnote"},"content":[{"tag":"scripRef","attrs":{"passage":"Ps. 31.6,14,18","parsed":"|Ps|31|6|0|0;|Ps|31|14|0|0;|Ps|31|18|0|0","osisRef":"Bible:Ps.31.6 Bible:Ps.31.14 Bible:Ps.31.18","id":"vi.VIII.II-p22.1"},"content":["Ps. xxxi. 6, 14, 18"]},"."]}]}],"contents":["4.
