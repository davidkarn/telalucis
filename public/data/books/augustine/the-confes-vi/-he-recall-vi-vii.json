Then, again, a fiery region of destruction, with its\nchiefs and peoples. And similarly inside of this, a race full of\nsmoke and gloom, where abode the dreadful prince and chief of all,\nhaving around him innumerable princes, himself the mind and source\nof them all. Such are the five natures of the region of\ncorruption.\u201d Augustin also designates them (",{"tag":"i","attrs":null,"content":["ibid."]}," sec. 20)\n\u201cthe five dens of the race of darkness.\u201d The nation of darkness\ndesires to possess the kingdom of light, and prepares to make war\nupon it; and in the controversy with Faustus we have (2) the\nbeginning and issue of the war (",{"tag":"i","attrs":null,"content":["Con.

This man, then, by name\nFirminius, having received a liberal education, and being well\nversed in rhetoric, consulted me, as one very dear to him, as to\nwhat I thought on some affairs of his, wherein his worldly hopes\nhad risen, viewed with regard to his so-called constellations; and\nI, who had now begun to lean in this particular towards\nNebridius\u2019 opinion, did not indeed decline to speculate about the\nmatter, and to tell him what came into my irresolute mind, but\nstill added that I was now almost persuaded that these were but\nempty and ridiculous follies. Upon this he told me that his father\nhad been very curious in such books, and that he had a friend who\nwas as interested in them as he was himself, who, with combined\nstudy and consultation, fanned the flame of their affection for\nthese toys, insomuch that they would observe the moment when the\nvery dumb animals which bred in their houses brought forth, and\nthen observed the position of the heavens with regard to them, so\nas to gather fresh proofs of this so-called art. He said, moreover,\nthat his father had told him, that at the time his mother was about\nto give birth to him (Firminius), a female servant of that friend\nof his father\u2019s was also great with child, which could not be\nhidden from her master, who took care with most diligent exactness\nto know of the birth of his very dogs. And so it came to pass that\n(the one for his wife, and the other for his ser","vant, with the most careful\nobservation, calculating the days and hours, and the smaller\ndivisions of the hours) both were delivered at the same moment, so\nthat both were compelled to allow the very selfsame constellations,\neven to the minutest point, the one for his son, the other for his\nyoung slave. For so soon as the women began to be in travail, they\neach gave notice to the other of what was fallen out in their\nrespective houses, and had messengers ready to despatch to one\nanother so soon as they had information of the actual birth, of\nwhich they had easily provided, each in his own province, to give\ninstant intelligence. Thus, then, he said, the messengers of the\nrespective parties met one another in such equal distances from\neither house, that neither of them could discern any difference\neither in the position of the stars or other most minute points.\nAnd yet Firminius, born in a high estate in his parents\u2019 house,\nran his course through the prosperous paths of this world, was\nincreased in wealth, and elevated to honours; whereas that\nslave\u2014the yoke of his condition being unrelaxed\u2014continued to\nserve his masters, as Firminius, who knew him, informed me."]},{"notes":[],"contents":["9. Upon hearing and believing these things, related\nby so reliable a person, all that resistance of mine melted away;\nand first I endeavoured to reclaim Firminius himself from that\ncuriosity, by telling him, that upon inspecting his constellations,\nI ought, were I to foretell truly, to have seen in them parents\neminent among their neighbours, a noble family in its own city,\ngood birth, becoming education, and liberal learning. But if that\nservant had consulted me upon the same constellations, since they\nwere his also, I ought again to tell him, likewise truly, to see in\nthem the meanness of his origin, the abjectness of his condition,\nand everything else altogether removed from and at variance with\nthe former. Whence, then, looking upon the same constellations, I\nshould, if I spoke the truth, speak diverse things, or if I spoke\nthe same, speak falsely; thence assuredly was it to be gathered,\nthat whatever, upon consideration of the constellations, was\nforetold truly, was not by art, but by chance; and whatever\nfalsely, was not from the unskillfulness of the art, but the error\nof chance."]},{"notes":[{"tag":"note","attrs":{"place":"end","n":"491","id":"vi.VII.VI-p6.1","anchored":"yes"},"content":[{"tag":"p","attrs":{"shownumber":"no","id":"vi.VII.VI-p7","class":"endnote"},"content":[" He uses the same illustration when speaking of the\n",{"tag":"i","attrs":null,"content":["mathematici"]},", or astrologers, in his ",{"tag":"i","attrs":null,"content":["De Doct.

In giving an account, remarks\nPusey, of this period to his friend and patron Romanianus, St.\nAugustin seems to have blended together this and the history of his\ncompleted conversion, which was also wrought in connection with\nwords in the same apostle, but the account of which he uniformly\nsuppresses, for fear, probably, of injuring the individual to whom\nhe was writing (see on book ix. sec. 4, note, below). \u201cSince that\nvehement flame which was about to seize me as yet was not, I\nthought that by which I was slowly kindled was the very greatest.\nWhen lo! certain books, when they had distilled a very few drops of\nmost precious unguent on that tiny flame, it is past belief,\nRomanianus, past belief, and perhaps past what even you believe of\nme (and what could I say more?), nay, to myself also is it past\nbelief, what a conflagration of myself they lighted. What ambition,\nwhat human show, what empty love of fame, or, lastly, what\nincitement or band of this mortal life could hold me then? I turned\nspeedily and wholly back into myself. I cast but a glance, I\nconfess, as one passing on, upon that religion which was implanted\ninto us as boys, and interwoven with our very inmost selves; but\nshe drew me unknowing to herself. So then, stumbling, hurrying,\nhesitating, I seized the Apostle Paul; \u2018for never,\u2019 said I,\n\u2018could they have wrought such things, or lived as it is plain\nthey did live, if their writings and arguments were opposed to this\nso high good.\u2019 I read the whole most intently and carefully.
