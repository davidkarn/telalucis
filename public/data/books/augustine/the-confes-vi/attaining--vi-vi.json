As if there could not be a real terrestrial paradise! As\nif there never existed these two women, Sarah and Hagar, nor the\ntwo sons who were born to Abraham, the one of the bond-woman, the\nother of the free, because the apostle says that in them the two\ncovenants were prefigured! or as if water never flowed from the\nrock when Moses struck it, because therein Christ can be seen in a\nfigure, as the same apostle says: \u2018Now that rock was Christ\u2019\n(",{"tag":"scripRef","attrs":{"passage":"1 Cor. 10.4","parsed":"|1Cor|10|4|0|0","osisRef":"Bible:1Cor.10.4","id":"vi.VI.IV-p4.2"},"content":["1\nCor. x. 4"]},").\u2026These and\nsimilar allegorical interpretations may be suitably put upon\nparadise without giving offence to any one, while ",{"tag":"i","attrs":null,"content":["yet we believe\nthe strict truth of the history"]},", confirmed by its\ncircumstantial narrative of facts.\u201d The allusion in the above\npassage to Sarah and Hagar invites the remark, that in ",{"tag":"scripRef","attrs":{"passage":"Gal. 4.24","parsed":"|Gal|4|24|0|0","osisRef":"Bible:Gal.4.24","id":"vi.VI.IV-p4.3"},"content":["Galatians\niv. 24"]},", the words in our\nversion rendered, \u201cwhich things are an allegory,\u201d should be,\n\u201cwhich things are such as may be allegorized.\u201d [",{"tag":"span","attrs":{"lang":"EL","id":"vi.VI.IV-p4.4","class":"Greek"},"content":["\u1f09\u03c4\u03b9\u03bd\u1f71 \u1f10\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03bd \u1f00\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03b3\u03bf\u03c1\u03bf\u1f7b\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03b1"]},".

The outside of the edifice was encrusted\nwith marble, and decorated with statues. The slopes of the vast\nconcave which formed the inside were filled and surrounded with\nsixty or eighty rows of seats of marble, likewise covered with\ncushions, and capable of receiving with ease above fourscore\nthousand spectators. Sixty-four vomitories (for by that name the\ndoors were very aptly distinguished) poured forth the immense\nmultitude; and the entrances, passages, and staircases were\ncontrived with such exquisite skill, that each person, whether of\nthe senatorial, the equestrian, or the plebeian order, arrived at\nhis destined place without trouble or confusion. Nothing was\nomitted which in any respect could be subservient to the\nconvenience or pleasure of the spectators. They were protected from\nthe sun and rain by an ample canopy occasionally drawn over their\nheads. The air was continually refreshed by the playing of\nfountains, and profusely impregnated by the grateful scent of\naromatics. In the centre of the edifice, the arena, or stage, was\nstrewed with the finest sand, and successively assumed the most\ndifferent forms; at one moment it seemed to rise out of the earth,\nlike the garden of the Hesperides, and was afterwards broken into\nthe rocks and caverns of Thrace.
