For when it is sung, its sound is heard\nat the same time; seeing there is not first a formless sound, which\nis afterwards formed into a song. For as soon as it shall have\nfirst sounded it passeth away; nor canst thou find anything of it,\nwhich being recalled thou canst by art compose. And, therefore, the\nsong is absorbed in its own sound, which sound of it is its matter.\nBecause this same is formed that it may be a tune; and therefore,\nas I was saying, the matter of the sound is prior to the form of\nthe tune, not before through any power of making it a tune; for\nneither is a sound the composer of the tune, but is sent forth from\nthe body and is subjected to the soul of the singer, that from it\nhe may form a tune. Nor is it first in time, for it is given forth\ntogether with the tune; nor first in choice, for a sound is not\nbetter than a tune, since a tune is not merely a sound, but a\nbeautiful sound. But it is first in origin, because the tune is not\nformed that it may become a sound, but the sound is formed that it\nmay become a tune.
