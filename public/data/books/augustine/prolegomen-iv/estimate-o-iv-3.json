Bindemann"]," (a\nLutheran divine) begins his thorough monograph (vol. i. preface)\nwith the well-deserved eulogium: \u201cSt. Augustin is one of the\ngreatest personages in the church. He is second in importance to\nnone of the teachers who have wrought most in the church since the\napostolic times; and it can well be said that among the church\nfathers the first place is due to him, and in the time of the\nReformation a Luther alone, for fulness and depth of thought and\ngrandeur of character, may stand by his side. He is the summit of\nthe development of the medi\u00e6val Western church; from him descended\nthe mysticism, no less than the scholasticism, of the middle age;\nhe was one of the strongest pillars of the Roman Catholicism, and\nfrom his works, next to the Holy Scriptures, especially the\nEpistles of Paul, the leader of the Reformation drew most of that\nconviction by which a new age was introduced.\u201d ",["\nStaudenmaier"],", a Roman Catholic theologian, counts Augustin\namong those minds in which an hundred others dwell (",[{"notes":[],"contents":"Scotus\nErigena"}],", i. p. 274). The Roman Catholic philosophers ",["A. G\u00fcnther"]," and ",["Th.\nGangauf"],", put him on an equality with the greatest\nphilosophers, and discern in him a providential personage endowed\nby the Spirit of God for the instruction of all ages. A striking\ncharacterization is that of the Old Catholic Dr. ",["\nHuber"]," (in his instructive work: ",[{"notes":[],"contents":"Die Philosophie der\nKirchenv\u00e4ter"}],", Munich, 1859, p. 312 sq.): \u201cAugustin is a\nunique phenomenon in Christian history. No one of the other fathers\nhas left so luminous traces of his existence. Though we find among\nthem many rich and powerful minds, yet we find in none the forces\nof personal character, ","mind, heart, and will, so largely developed and\nso harmoniously working. No one surpasses him in wealth of\nperceptions and dialectical sharpness of thoughts, in depth and\nfervour of religious sensibility, in greatness of aims and energy\nof action. He therefore also marks the culmination of the patristic\nage, and has been elevated by the acknowledgment of succeeding\ntimes as the first and the universal church father.\u2014His whole\ncharacter reminds us in many respects of Paul, with whom he has\nalso in common the experience of being called from manifold errors\nto the service of the gospel, and like whom he could boast that he\nhad laboured in it more abundantly than all the others. And as Paul\namong the Apostles pre-eminently determined the development of\nChristianity, and became, more than all the others, the expression\nof the Christian mind, to which men ever afterwards return, as\noften as in the life of the church that mind becomes turbid, to\ndraw from him, as the purest fountain, a fresh understanding of the\ngospel doctrine,\u2014so has Augustin turned the Christian nations\nsince his time for the most part into his paths, and become\npre-eminently their trainer and teacher, in the study of whom they\nalways gain a renewal and deepening of their Christian\nconsciousness. Not the middle age alone, but the Reformation also,\nwas ruled by him, and whatever to this day boasts of the Christian\nspirit, is connected at least in part with Augustin.\u201d ",["Villemain"],", in his able and eloquent,\n\u201c",[{"notes":[],"contents":"Tableau de l\u2019\u00e9loquence Chr\u00e9tienne au IV"},{"notes":[],"contents":["e"]},{"notes":[],"contents":"\nsi\u00e8cle"}],"\u201d (Paris, 1849, p. 373), commences his sketch of\nAugustin as follows: \u201c",[{"notes":[],"contents":"Nous arrivons a l\u2019homme le plus\n\u00eatonnant de l\u2019Eglise latine, \u00e0 celui qui portat le plus\nd\u2019imagination dans la th\u00e9ologie, le plus d\u2019\u00e9loquence et m\u00eame\nsensibilit\u00e9 dans la scholastique; ce fut saint Augustin.\nDonnez-lui un autre si\u00e8cle, placez-le dans meill\u00eaure\ncivilisation; et jamais homme n\u2019aura paru dou\u00e9 d\u2019un g\u00e9nie\nplus vaste et plus facile.

Glyn, 1868, Vol. I. p. 272), counts Augustin among the three or\nfour great metaphysicians of modern times, and says that his task\nwas \u201cto clear the two roads open to Christian philosophy and to\ninaugurate its two methods of mysticism and dogmatism.\u201d ",["Nourrisson"],", whose work on Augustin is clothed\nwith the authority of the Institute of France, assigns to him the\nfirst rank among the masters of human thought, alongside of Plato\nand Leibnitz, Thomas Aquinas and Bossuet. \u201c",[{"notes":[],"contents":"Si une critique\ntoujours respectueuse, mais d\u2019une inviolable sinc\u00e9rit\u00e9, est une\ndes formes les plus hautes de l\u2019admiration, j\u2019estime, au\ncontraire, n\u2019avoir fait qu\u2019exalter ce grand coeur, ce\npsychologue consolant et \u00e9mu, ce m\u00e9taphysicien subtil et sublime,\nen un mot, cet attachant et po\u00e9tique g\u00e9nie, dont la place reste\nmarqu\u00e9e, au premier rang, parmi les ma\u00eetres de la pens\u00e9e\nhumaine, \u00e1 c\u00f4t\u00e9 de Platon et de Descartes, d\u2019Aristote et de\nsaint Thomas, de Leibnitz et de Bossuet"}],".\u201d (",[{"notes":[],"contents":"La philosophie\nde saint Augustin"}],", Par. 1866, tom. i. p. vii.) ",["Pressens\u00e9"]," (in art. Aug., in Smith & Wace,\n",[{"notes":[],"contents":"Dict. of Christ. Biography"}],", I. 222): \u201cAug. still claims\nthe honour of having brought out in all its light the fundamental\ndoctrine of Christianity; despite the errors of his system, he has\nopened to the church the path of every progress and of every\nreform, by stating with the utmost vigour the scheme of free\nsalvation which he had learnt in the school of St. Paul.\u201d Among\nEnglish and American writers, Dr. ",["Shedd"],", in\nthe Introduction to his edition of the ",[{"notes":[],"contents":"Confessions"}]," (1860),\nhas furnished a truthful and forcible description of the mind and\nheart of St. Augustin.

I. 522): \u201cThe full\nsignificance of Augustin as an author can be measured only from the\nconsideration of the fact that in the middle ages both\nscholasticism and mysticism lived of his riches, and that\nafterwards Luther and Calvin drew out of his fulness. We find in\nhim both the sharp understanding which makes salvation depend on\nthe clearly defined dogma of the church, and the loving absorption\nof the heart in God which scarcely needs any more the aid of the\nchurch. His writings reflect all kinds of Christian thoughts, which\nlie a thousand years apart and appear to be contradictions. How\nwere they possible in so systematic a thinker? Just as much as they\nwere possible in Christianity, of which he was a microcosmus. From\nthe dogmatic abyss of his hardest and most illiberal doctrines\narise such liberal sentences as these: \u2018Him I shall not condemn\nin whom I find any thing of Christ;\u2019 \u2018Let us not forget that in\nthe very enemies are concealed the future citizens.\u2019\u201d"]}]}
