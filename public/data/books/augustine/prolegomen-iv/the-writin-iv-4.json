From the undeniable existence and possession by man of\nsome truth, he concludes to the existence of God as the truth ",[{"notes":[],"contents":"\nper se"}],"; but our conviction of the existence of the material\nworld he regards as only an irresistible belief. Combating heathen\nreligion and philosophy, Augustin defends the doctrines and\ninstitutions peculiar to Christianity, and maintains, in\nparticular, against the Neo-Platoniste, whom he rates most highly\namong all the ancient philosophers, the Christian theses that\nsalvation is to be found in Christ alone, that divine worship is\ndue to no other being beside the triune God, since he created all\nthings himself, and did not commission inferior beings, gods,\ndemons, or angels to create the material world; that the soul with\nits body will rise again to eternal salvation or damnation, but\nwill not return periodically to renewed life upon the earth; that\nthe soul begins to exist at the same time with the body; that the\nworld both had a beginning and is perishable, and that only God and\nthe souls of angels and men are eternal.\u2014Against the dualism of\nthe Manich\u00e6ans, who regarded good and evil as equally primitive,\nand represented a portion of the divine substance as having entered\ninto the region of evil, in order to war against and conquer it,\nAugustin defends the monism of the good principle, or of the purely\nspiritual God, explaining evil as a mere negation or privation, and\nseeking to show from the finiteness of the things in the world, and\nfrom the differing degrees of perfection, that the evils in the\nworld are necessary, and not in contradiction with the idea of\ncreation; he also defends in opposition to Manich\u00e6ism, and\nGnosticism in general, the Catholic doctrine of the essential\nharmony between the Old and New Testaments.

The system gives all glory to God, does\nfull justice to the sovereignty of divine grace, effectually\nhumbles and yet elevates and fortifies man, and furnishes the\nstrongest stimulus to gratitude and the firmest foundation of\ncomfort. It makes all bright and lovely in the circle of the elect.\nBut it is gloomy and repulsive in its negative aspect towards the\nnon-elect. It teaches a universal damnation and only a partial\nredemption, and confines the offer of salvation to the minority of\nthe elect; it ignores the general benevolence of God to all his\ncreatures; it weakens or perverts the passages which clearly teach\nthat \u201cGod would have all men to be saved\u201d; it suspends their\neternal fate upon one single act of disobedience; it assumes an\nunconscious, and yet responsible pre-existence of Adam\u2019s\nposterity and their participation in his sin and guilt; it reflects\nupon the wisdom of God in creating countless millions of beings\nwith the eternal foreknowledge of their everlasting misery; and it\ndoes violence to the sense of individual responsibility for\naccepting or rejecting the gospel-offer of salvation. And yet this\nAugustinian system, especially in its severest Calvinistic form,\nhas promoted civil and religious liberty, and trained the most\nvirtuous, independent, and heroic types of Christians, as the\nHuguenots, the Puritans, the Covenanters, and the Pilgrim Fathers.\nIt is still a mighty moral power, and will not lose its hold upon\nearnest characters until some great theological genius produces\nfrom the inexhaustible mine of the Scriptures a more satisfactory\nsolution of the awful problem which the universal reign of sin and\ndeath presents to the thinking mind."]},{"notes":[],"contents":["In Augustin the anti-Pelagian system was checked and\nmoderated by his churchly and sacramental views, and we cannot\nunderstand him without keeping both in view.
