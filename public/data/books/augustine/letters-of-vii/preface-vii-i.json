It was a characteristic remark of Horace\nWalpole\u2019s, that \u201cnothing gives so just an idea of an age as\ngenuine letters; nay, history waits for its last seal from them.\u201d\nA still greater authority, Bacon, in his marvellous distribution of\nall knowledge, gives to letters the highest place among the\n\u201cAppendices to History.\u201d \u201cLetters,\u201d he says, \u201care,\naccording to all the variety of occasions, advertisements, advices,\ndirections, propositions, petitions commendatory, expostulatory,\nsatisfactory; of compliment, of pleasure, of discourse, and all\nother passages of action. And such as are written from wise men\nare, of all the words of man, in my judgment, the best; for they\nare more natural than orations and public speeches, and more\nadvised than conferences or present speeches. So, again, letters of\naffairs from such as manage them, or are privy to them, are of all\nothers the best instructions for history, and to a diligent reader\nthe best histories in themselves.\u201d",{"tag":"note","id":"vii.i-p7.1"}," This is especially true of the\nLetters of Augustin. A large number of them are ecclesiastical and\ntheological, and would in our day have appeared as pamphlets, or\nwould have been delivered as lectures. There are none of his\nwritings which do not receive some supplementary light from his\nletters. The subjects of his more elaborate writings are here\nhandled in an easier manner, and their sources, ","motives, and origin are\ndisclosed. Difficulties which his published works had occasioned\nare here removed, new illustrations are noted, further developments\nand fresh complications of heresy are alluded to, and the whole\ntheological movement of the time is here reflected in a vivid and\ninteresting shape. No controversy of his age was settled without\nhis voice, and it is in his letters we chiefly see the vastness of\nhis empire, the variety of subjects on which appeal was made to\nhim, and the deference with which his judgment was received.\nInquiring philosophers, puzzled statesmen, angry heretics, pious\nladies, all found their way to the Bishop of Hippo. And while he\ncontinually complains of want of leisure, of the multifarious\nbusiness of his episcopate, of the unwarranted demands made upon\nhim, he yet carefully answers all. Sometimes he writes with the\ncourier who is to carry his letter impatiently chafing outside the\ndoor; sometimes a promptly written reply is carried round the whole\nknown world by some faithless messenger before it reaches his\nanxious correspondent; but, amidst difficulties unthought of under\na postal system, his indefatigable diligence succeeds in diffusing\nintelligence and counsel to the most distant inquirers."]},{"notes":[],"contents":["In the present volume we have, as usual, followed\nthe Benedictine edition. Among the many labours which the\nBenedictine Fathers encountered in editing the works of Augustin,\nthey undertook the onerous task of rearranging the Epistles in\nchronological order. The manner in which this task has been\nexecuted is eminently characteristic of their unostentatious\npatience and skill. Their order has been universally adopted; it is\nto this order that reference is made when any writer cites a letter\nof Augustin\u2019s; and therefore it matters less whether in each case\nthe date assigned by the Benedictine editors can be accepted as\naccurate. It will be seen that we have not considered it desirable\nto translate all the letters. Of those addressed to Augustin we\nhave omitted a few which were neither important in themselves nor\nindispensable for the understanding of his replies; and, when any\nof his own letters is a mere repetition of what he has previously\nwritten to another correspondent, we have contented ourselves, and,\nwe hope, shall satisfy our readers, with a reference to the former\nletter in which the arguments and illustrations now repeated may be\nfound."]},{"notes":[],"contents":["No English translation of these Letters has\npreviously appeared.
