In\nthe first place, we must observe that the things which we remember\nare not always things which are passing away, but are for the most\npart things which are permanent. Wherefore, seeing that the\nfunction of memory is to retain hold of what belongs to time past,\nit is certain that it embraces on the one hand things which leave\nus, and on the other hand things from which we go away.

For my purpose\nit suffices meanwhile to have proved in this way that memory can be\nspoken of as embracing also those things which have not yet passed\naway: and now mark attentively how this supports my opinion. Some\nmen raise a groundless objection to that most famous theory\ninvented by Socrates, according to which the things that we learn\nare not introduced to our minds as new, but brought back to memory\nby a process of recollection; supporting their objection by\naffirming that memory has to do only with things which have passed\naway, whereas, as Plato himself has taught, those things which we\nlearn by the exercise of the understanding are permanent, and being\nimperishable, cannot be numbered among things which have passed\naway: the mistake into which they have fallen arising obviously\nfrom this, that they do not consider that it is only the mental act\nof apprehension by which we have discerned these things which\nbelongs to the past; and that it is because we have, in the stream\nof mental activity, left these behind, and begun in a variety of\nways to attend to other things, that we require to return to them\nby an effort of recollection, that is, by memory. If, therefore,\npassing over other examples, we fix our thoughts upon eternity\nitself as something which is for ever permanent, and consider, on\nthe one hand, that it does not require any image fashioned by the\nimagination as the vehicle by which it may be introduced into the\nmind; and, on the other hand, that it could never enter the mind\notherwise than by our remembering it,\u2014we shall see that, in\nregard to some things at least, there can be an exercise of memory\nwithout any image of the thing remembered being presented by the\nimagination."]},{"notes":[],"contents":[["Chap.

In\ngeometry, the idea of an angle is one thing, the idea of a square\nis another. As often, therefore, as I please to describe an angle,\nthe idea of the angle, and that alone, is present to my mind; but I\ncan never describe a square unless I fix my attention upon the idea\nof four angles at the same time.

If, therefore, Nebridius is a\npart of this universe, as he is, and the whole universe is made up\nof parts, the God who made the universe could not but have in His\nplan the idea of all the parts. Wherefore, since there is in this\nidea of a very great number of men, it does not belong to man\nhimself as such; although, on the other hand, all the individuals\nare in wonderful ways reduced to one.

For nothing written by me will find in you a reluctant\nreader; for I know the goodwill which you cherish towards me. Let\nme say, however, that if, on reading these things, you approve of\nthem, and perceive them to be true, you must not consider them to\nbe mine otherwise than as given to me; and you are at liberty to\nturn to that same source whence proceeds also the power given you\nto appreciate their truth. For no one discerns the truth of that\nwhich he reads from anything which is in the mere manuscript, or in\nthe writer, but rather by something within himself, if the light of\ntruth, shining with a clearness beyond what is men\u2019s common lot,\nand very far removed from the darkening influence of the body, has\npenetrated his own mind. If, however, you discover some things\nwhich are false and deserve to be rejected, I would have you know\nthat these things have fallen as dew from the mists of human\nfrailty, and these you are to reckon as truly mine. I would exhort\nyou to persevere in seeking the truth, were it not that I seem to\nsee the mouth of your heart already opened wide to drink it in. I\nwould also exhort you to cling with manly tenacity to the truth\nwhich you have learned, were it not that you already manifest in\nthe clearest manner that you possess strength of mind and fixedness\nof purpose. For all that lives within you has, in the short time of\nour fellowship, revealed itself to me, almost as if the bodily veil\nhad been rent asunder. And surely the merciful providence of our\nGod can in no wise permit a man so good and so remarkably gifted as\nyou are to be an alien from the flock of Christ."]}]},{"title":"To Antoninus","node-type":"section","sub-title":"Letter XX","id":"vii.1.XX","type":"Letter","shorttitle":"Letter XX","number":"XX","children":[{"notes":[],"contents":[["Letter XX."]]},{"notes":[],"contents":["(",["a.d."]," 390.)"]},{"notes":[],"contents":[["To Antoninus Augustin Sends\nGreeting."]]},{"notes":[],"contents":["1.

Thereupon he produced a certain volume, by which\nhe wished to show that a Council at Sardica had sent a letter to\nAfrican bishops who belonged to the party of Donatus. When this was\nread aloud, I heard the name Donatus among the bishops to whom the\nwriting had been sent. I therefore insisted upon being told whether\nthis was the Donatus from whom their faction takes its name; as it\nwas possible that they had written to some bishop named Donatus\nbelonging to another section [heresy], especially since in these\nnames no mention had been made of Africa. How then, I asked, could\nit be proved that we must believe the Donatus here named to be the\nDonatist bishop, when it could not even be proved that this letter\nhad been specially directed to bishops in Africa? For although\nDonatus is a common African name, there is nothing improbable in\nthe supposition, that either some one in other countries should be\nfound bearing an African name, or that a native of Africa should be\nmade a bishop there. We found, moreover, no day or name of consul\ngiven in the letter, from which any certain light might have been\nfurnished by comparison of dates. I had indeed once heard that the\nArians, when they had separated from the Catholic communion, had\nendeavoured to ally the Donatists in Africa with themselves; and my\nbrother Alypius recalled this to me at the time in a whisper.\nHaving then taken up the volume itself, and glancing over the\ndecrees of the said Council, I read that Athanasius, Catholic\nbishop of Alexandria, who was so conspicuous as a debater in the\nkeen controversies with the Arians, and Julius, bishop of the Roman\nChurch, also a Catholic, had been condemned by that Council of\nSardica; from which we were sure that it was a Council of Arians,\nagainst which heretics these Catholic bishops had contended with\nsingular fervour. I therefore wished to take up and carry with me\nthe volume, in order to give more pains to find out the date of the\nCouncil. He refused it, however, saying that I could get it there\nif I wished to study anything in it. I asked also that he would\nallow me to mark the volume; for I feared, I confess, lest, if\nperchance necessity arose for my asking to consult it, another\nshould be substituted in its room.

When I\nperceived that he still laid great stress upon this, wishing to\nhave the justice of the cause of his party acknowledged as beyond\ndispute because they had suffered persecution, I asked him whether\nhe believed Ambrose, bishop of the Church of Milan, to be a\nrighteous man and a Christian? He was compelled to deny expressly\nthat that man was a Christian and a righteous man; for if he had\nadmitted this, I would at once have objected to him that he\nesteemed it necessary for him to be rebaptized. When, therefore, he\nwas compelled to pronounce concerning Ambrose that he was not a\nChristian nor a righteous man, I related the persecution which he\nendured when his church was surrounded with soldiers. I also asked\nwhether Maximianus, who had made a schism from their party at\nCarthage, was in his view a righteous man and a Christian. He could\nnot but deny this.

One of your doubts is as to using the\nservices of a man who has guaranteed his fidelity by swearing by\nhis false gods. In this matter I beg you to consider whether, in\nthe event of a man failing to keep his word after having pledged\nhimself by such an oath, you would not regard him as guilty of a\ntwofold sin. For if he kept the engagement which he had confirmed\nby this oath, he would be pronounced guilty in this only, that he\nswore by such deities; but no one would justly blame him for\nkeeping his engagement. But in the case supposed, seeing that he\nboth swore by those whom he should not worship, and did,\nnotwithstanding his promise, what he should not have done, he was\nguilty of two sins: whence it is obvious that in using, not for an\nevil work, but for some good and lawful end, the service of a man\nwhose fidelity is known to have been confirmed by an oath in the\nname of false gods, one participates, not in the sin of swearing by\nthe false gods, but in the good faith with which he keeps his\npromise. The faith which I here speak of as kept is not that on\naccount of which those who are baptized in Christ are called\nfaithful: that is entirely different and far removed from the faith\ndesiderated in regard to the arrangements and compacts of men.\nNevertheless it is, beyond all doubt, worse to swear falsely by the\ntrue God than to swear truly by the false gods; for the greater the\nholiness of that by which we swear, the greater is the sin of\nperjury. It is therefore a different question whether he is not\nguilty who requires another to pledge himself by taking an oath in\nthe name of his gods, seeing that he worships false gods. In\nanswering this question, we may accept as decisive those examples\nwhich you yourself quoted of Laban and of Abimelech (if Abimelech\ndid swear by his gods, as Laban swore by the god of Nahor). This\nis, as I have said, another question, and one which would perchance\nperplex me, were it not for those examples of Isaac and Jacob, to\nwhich, for aught I know, others might be added.

I know, however, that our opinion is different:\nwherefore it should not be discussed at present; let us rather\ntreat of that about which you have thought of asking my advice. On\nthe same ground on which you forbear from swearing yourself, you\nmay, if such be your opinion, regard it as forbidden to exact an\noath from another, although it is expressly said, Swear not; but I\ndo not remember reading anywhere in Holy Scripture that we are not\nto take another\u2019s oath. The question whether we ought to take\nadvantage of the concord which is established between other parties\nby their exchange of oaths is entirely different. If we answer this\nin the negative, I know not whether we could find any place on\nearth in which we could live. For not only on the frontier, but\nthroughout all the provinces, the security of peace rests on the\noaths of barbarians. And from this it would follow, that not only\nthe crops which are guarded by men who have sworn fidelity in the\nname of their false gods, but all things which enjoy the protection\nsecured by the peace which a similar oath has ratified, are\ndefiled.

I can prove this, if you\ndeny it. Your own Council is witness. We have also the proconsular\nActs, in which you have not once, but often, affirmed this.\nProvide, therefore, some other line of defence if you can, lest,\ndenying what I can prove, you cause loss of time. If, then,\nFelicianus and Pr\u00e6textatus were innocent, why were they thus\ncondemned? If they were guilty, why were they thus restored? If you\nprove them to have been innocent, can you object to our believing\nthat it was possible for innocent men, falsely charged with being\ntraditors, to be condemned by a much smaller number of your\npredecessors, if it is found possible for innocent men, falsely\ncharged with being schismatics, to be condemned by three hundred\nand ten of their successors, whose decision is magniloquently\ndescribed as proceeding from \u201cthe unerring voice of a plenary\nCouncil\u201d?

Again, you are wont to say that we have not the\nbaptism of Christ, and that beyond your communion it is not to be\nfound. On this I would enter into a more lengthened argument; but\nin dealing with you this is not necessary, seeing that, along with\nFelicianus and Pr\u00e6textatus, you admitted also the baptism of the\nMaximianists as valid. For all whom these bishops baptized so long\nas they were in communion with Maximianus, while you were doing\nyour utmost in a protracted contest in the civil courts to expel\nthese very men [Felicianus and Pr\u00e6textatus] from their churches,\nas the Acts testify,\u2014all those, I say, whom they baptized during\nthat time, they now have in fellowship with them and with you; and\nthough these were baptized by them when excommunicated and in the\nguilt of schism, not only in cases of extremity through dangerous\nsickness, but also at the Easter services, in the large number of\nchurches belonging to their cities, and in these important cities\nthemselves,\u2014in the case of none of them has the rite of baptism\nbeen repeated. And I wish you could prove that those whom\nFelicianus and Pr\u00e6textatus had baptized, as it were, in vain, when\nthey were excommunicated and in the guilt of schism, were\nsatisfactorily baptized again by them when they were restored. For\nif the renewal of baptism was necessary for the people, the renewal\nof ordination was not less necessary for the bishops.

But the Lord our God, who is\ncompassionate and merciful, who comforteth them that are cast down,\nnourishing the infants, and cherishing the infirm, permitted him to\ngain in some measure success in this design, only to make us\nrejoice more over the prevention of the calamity than we grieved\nover the danger. For it is a far more magnanimous thing to have\nresigned the onerous responsibilities of the bishop\u2019s dignity in\norder to save the Church from danger, than to have accepted these\nin order to have a share in her government. He truly proves that he\nwas worthy of holding that office, had the interests of peace\npermitted him to do so, who does not insist upon retaining it when\nhe cannot do so without endangering the peace of the Church. It has\naccordingly pleased God to show, by means of your brother, our\nbeloved son Maximianus, unto the enemies of His Church, that there\nare within her those who seek not their own things, but the things\nof Jesus Christ. For in laying down that ministry of stewardship of\nthe mysteries of God, he was not deserting his duty under the\npressure of some worldly desire, but acting under the impulse of a\npious love of peace, lest, on account of the honour conferred upon\nhim, there should arise among the members of Christ an unseemly and\ndangerous, perhaps even fatal, dissension. For could anything have\nbeen more infatuated and worthy of utter reprobation, than to\nforsake schismatics because of the peace of the Catholic Church,\nand then to trouble that same Catholic peace by the question of\none\u2019s own rank and preferment? On the other hand, could anything\nbe more praiseworthy, and more in accordance with Christian\ncharity, than that, after having forsaken the frenzied pride of the\nDonatists, he should, in the manner of his cleaving to the heritage\nof Christ, give such a signal proof of humility under the power of\nlove for the unity of the Church? As for him, therefore, we rejoice\nindeed that he has been proved of such stability that the storm of\nthis temptation has not cast down what divine truth had built in\nhis heart; and therefore we desire and pray the Lord to grant that,\nby his life and conversation in the future, he may make it more and\nmore manifest how well he would have discharged the\nresponsibilities of that office which he would have accepted if\nthat had been his duty.

I maintain, therefore, that circumcision, and\nother things of this kind, were, by means of what is called the Old\nTestament, given to the Jews with divine authority, as signs of\nfuture things which were to be fulfilled in Christ; and that now,\nwhen these things have been fulfilled, the laws concerning these\nrights remained only to be read by Christians in order to their\nunderstanding the prophecies which had been given before, but not\nto be of necessity practised by them, as if the coming of that\nrevelation of faith which they prefigured was still future.\nAlthough, however, these rites were not to be imposed upon the\nGentiles, the compliance with them, to which the Jews had been\naccustomed, was not to be prohibited in such a way as to give the\nimpression that it was worthy of abhorrence and condemnation.\nTherefore slowly, and by degrees, all this observance of these\ntypes was to vanish away through the power of the sound preaching\nof the truth of the grace of Christ, to which alone believers would\nbe taught to ascribe their justification and salvation, and not to\nthose types and shadows of things which till then had been future,\nbut which were now newly come and present, as at the time of the\ncalling of those Jews whom the personal coming of our Lord and the\napostolic times had found accustomed to the observance of these\nceremonial institutions. The toleration, for the time, of their\ncontinuing to observe these was enough to declare their excellence\nas things which, though they were to be given up, were not, like\nthe worship of idols, worthy of abhorrence; but they were not to be\nimposed upon others, lest they should be thought necessary, either\nas means or as conditions of salvation. This was the opinion of\nthose heretics who, while anxious to be both Jews and Christians,\ncould not be either the one or the other. Against this opinion you\nhave most benevolently condescended to warn me, although I never\nentertained it. This also was the opinion with which, through fear,\nPeter fell into the fault of pretending to yield concurrence,\nthough in reality he did not agree with it; for which reason Paul\nwrote most truly of him, that he saw him not walking uprightly,\naccording to the truth of the gospel, and most truly said of him\nthat he was compelling the Gentiles to live as did the Jews. Paul\ndid not impose this burden on the Gentiles through his sincerely\ncomplying, when it was needful, with these ceremonies, with the\ndesign of proving that they were not to be utterly condemned (as\nidol-worship ought to be); for he nevertheless constantly preached\nthat not by these things, but by the grace revealed to faith,\nbelievers obtain salvation, lest he should lead any one to take up\nthese Jewish observances as necessary to salvation. Thus,\ntherefore, I believe that the Apostle Paul did all these things\nhonestly, and without dissimulation; and yet if any one now leave\nJudaism and become a Christian, I neither compel nor permit him to\nimitate Paul\u2019s example, and go on with the sincere observance of\nJewish rites, any more than you, who think that Paul dissembled\nwhen he practised these rites, would compel or permit such an one\nto follow the apostle in that dissimulation."]},{"notes":[{"tag":"note","attrs":{"place":"end","n":"2028","id":"vii.1.LXXXII-p38.1","anchored":"yes"},"content":[{"tag":"p","attrs":{"shownumber":"no","id":"vii.1.LXXXII-p39","class":"endnote"},"content":[" See Letter LXXV. sec. 13, p. 338."]}]}],"contents":["16. Shall I also sum up \u201cthe matter in\ndebate, or rather your opinion concerning it\u201d",{"tag":"note","id":"vii.1.LXXXII-p38.1"}," (to quote your own expression)? It\nseems to me to be this: that after the gospel of Christ has been\npublished, the Jews who believe do rightly if they offer sacrifices\nas Paul did, if they circumcise their children as Paul circumcised\nTimothy, and if they observe the \u201cseventh day of the week, as the\nJews have always done, provided only that they do all this as\ndissemblers and deceivers.\u201d If this is your doctrine, we are now\nprecipitated, not into the heresy of Ebion, or of those who are\ncommonly called Nazarenes, or any other known heresy, but into some\nnew error, which is all the more pernicious because it originates\nnot in mistake, but in deliberate and designed endeavour to\ndeceive. If, in order to clear yourself from the charge of\nentertaining such sentiments, you answer that the apostles were to\nbe commended for dissimulation in these instances, their purpose\nbeing to avoid giving offence to the many weak Jewish believers who\ndid not yet understand that these things were to be rejected, but\nthat now, when the doctrine of Christ\u2019s grace has been firmly\nestablished throughout so many nations, and when, by the reading of\nthe Law and the Prophets throughout all the churches of Christ, it\nis well known that these are not read for our observance, but for\nour instruction, any man who should propose to feign compliance\nwith these rites would be regarded as a madman. What objection can\nthere be to my affirming that the Apostle Paul, and ","other sound and faithful\nChristians, were bound sincerely to declare the worth of these old\nobservances by occasionally honouring them, lest it should be\nthought that these institutions, originally full of prophetic\nsignificance, and cherished sacredly by their most pious\nforefathers, were to be abhorred by their posterity as profane\ninventions of the devil? For now, when the faith had come, which,\npreviously foreshadowed by these ceremonies, was revealed after the\ndeath and resurrection of the Lord, they became, so far as their\noffice was concerned, defunct. But just as it is seemly that the\nbodies of the deceased be carried honourably to the grave by their\nkindred, so was it fitting that these rites should be removed in a\nmanner worthy of their origin and history, and this not with\npretence of respect, but as a religious duty, instead of being\nforsaken at once, or cast forth to be torn in pieces by the\nreproaches of their enemies, as by the teeth of dogs. To carry the\nillustration further, if now any Christian (though he may have been\nconverted from Judaism) were proposing to imitate the apostles in\nthe observance of these ceremonies, like one who disturbs the ashes\nof those who rest, he would be not piously performing his part in\nthe obsequies, but impiously violating the sepulchre."]},{"notes":[],"contents":["17. I acknowledge that in the statement\ncontained in my letter, to the effect that the reason why Paul\nundertook (although he was an apostle of Christ) to perform certain\nrites, was that he might show that these ceremonies were not\npernicious to those who desired to continue that which they had\nreceived by the Law from their fathers, I have not explicitly\nenough qualified the statement, by adding that this was the case\n",[{"notes":[],"contents":"only in that time in which the grace of faith was at first\nrevealed"}],"; for at that time this was not pernicious.

If you do presume to call that friend of the Bridegroom a\nheretic, and to say that he was not in the unity of the Church, I\nbeg that you will put this in writing. But if you believe that it\nwould be the height of folly to think or to say so, it remains for\nyour own wisdom to resolve the question why the Apostle Paul\nbaptized after John. For if he baptized after one who was his\nequal, you ought all to baptize after one another.

And because it was of Christ, therefore,\nalthough there was very great disparity in the persons by whom it\nwas administered, it was equally useful to those by whom it was\nreceived. For if the excellency of baptism in each case is\naccording to the excellency of the person by whom one is baptized,\nit was wrong in the apostle to give thanks that he had baptized\nnone of the Corinthians, but Crispus, and Gaius, and the house of\nStephanas;",{"tag":"note","id":"vii.1.XCIII-p187.2"}," for the\nbaptism of the converts in Corinth, if administered by himself,\nwould have been so much more excellent as Paul himself was more\nexcellent than other men.

For the holy\nangels do not approve of any sacrifice except what is offered,\nagreeably to the teaching of true wisdom and true religion, unto\nthe one true God, whom in holy fellowship they serve. Therefore, as\nimpious presumption, whether in men or in angels, commands or\ncovets the rendering to itself of those honours which belong to\nGod, so, on the other hand, pious humility, whether in men or in\nholy angels, declines these honours when offered, and declares to\nwhom alone they are due, of which most notable examples are\nconspicuously set forth in our sacred books."]},{"notes":[],"contents":["21.

To this I reply, that either all the miracles\nwrought by divine power may be treated as incredible, or there is\nno reason why the story of this miracle should not be believed. The\nresurrection of Christ Himself upon the third day would not be\nbelieved by us, if the Christian faith was afraid to encounter\nPagan ridicule. Since, however, our friend did not on this ground\nask whether it is to be believed that Lazarus was raised on the\nfourth day, or that Christ rose on the third day, I am much\nsurprised that he reckoned what was done with Jonah to be\nincredible; unless, perchance, he thinks it easier for a dead man\nto be raised in life from his sepulchre, than for a living man to\nbe kept in life in the spacious belly of a sea monster. For without\nmentioning the great size of sea monsters which is reported to us\nby those who have knowledge of them, let me ask how many men could\nbe contained in the belly which was fenced round with those huge\nribs which are fixed in a public place in Carthage, and are well\nknown to all men there? Who can be at a loss to conjecture how wide\nan entrance must have been given by the opening of the mouth which\nwas the gateway of that vast cavern? unless, perchance, as our\nfriend stated it, the clothing of Jonah stood in the way of his\nbeing swallowed without injury, as if he had required to squeeze\nhimself through a narrow passage, instead of being, as was the\ncase, thrown headlong through the air, and so caught by the sea\nmonster as to be received into its belly before he was wounded by\nits teeth. At the same time, the Scripture does not say whether he\nhad his clothes on or not when he was cast down into that cavern,\nso that it may without contradiction be understood that he made\nthat swift descent unclothed, if perchance it was necessary that\nhis garment should be taken from him, as the shell is taken from an\negg, to make him more easily swallowed. For men are as much\nconcerned about the raiment of this prophet as would be reasonable\nif it were stated that he had crept through a very small window, or\nhad been going into a bath; and yet, even though it were necessary\nin such circumstances to enter without parting with one\u2019s\nclothes, this would be only inconvenient, not miraculous."]},{"notes":[],"contents":["32.

And yet, if this which is written\nconcerning Jonah were said to have been done by Apuleius of Madaura\nor Apollonius of Tyana, by whom they boast, though unsupported by\nreliable testimony, that many wonders were performed (albeit even\nthe devils do some works like those done by the holy angels, not in\ntruth, but in appearance, not by wisdom, but manifestly by\nsubtlety),\u2014if, I say, any such event were narrated in connection\nwith these men to whom they give the flattering name of magicians\nor philosophers, we should hear from their mouths sounds not of\nderision, but of triumph. Be it so, then; let them laugh at our\nScriptures; let them laugh as much as they can, when they see\nthemselves daily becoming fewer in number, while some are removed\nby death, and others by their embracing the Christian faith, and\nwhen all those things are being fulfilled which were predicted by\nthe prophets who long ago laughed at them, and said that they would\nfight and bark against the truth in vain, and would gradually come\nover to our side; and who not only transmitted these statements to\nus, their descendants, for our learning, but promised that they\nshould be fulfilled in our experience."]},{"notes":[],"contents":["33.

You have in these words neither shut out the one\nreligion which is true, nor admitted other religions which are\nfalse; for certainly the way which brings us to the goal aspires\nthitherward, but not every way which aspires thitherward brings us\nto the place wherein all who are brought thither are unquestionably\nblest. Now we all wish, that is, we aspire, to be blest; but we\ncannot all achieve what we wish, that is, we do not all obtain what\nwe aspire to.

For when you were in your letter using every\nmeans to persuade me to answer the questions which you sent, you\nwrote these words: \u201cI might importune you at greater length, and\nthrough many of your dear friends; but I know your disposition,\nthat you do not desire to be solicited, but show kindness readily\nto all, if only there be nothing improper in the thing requested:\nand there is absolutely nothing improper in what I ask. Be this,\nhowever, as it may, I beg you to do me this kindness, for I am on\nthe point of embarking on a voyage.\u201d In these words of your\nletter you are indeed right in your opinion as to myself, that I am\ndesirous of showing kindness to all, if only there be nothing\nimproper in the request made; but it is not my opinion that there\nis nothing improper in what you ask. For when I consider how a\nbishop is distracted and overwrought by the cares of his office\nclamouring on every side, it does not seem to me proper for him\nsuddenly, as if deaf, to withdraw himself from all these, and\ndevote himself to the work of expounding to a single student some\nunimportant questions in the Dialogues of Cicero. The impropriety\nof this you yourself apprehend, although, carried away with zeal in\nthe pursuit of your studies, you will by no means give heed to it.\nFor what other construction can I put on the fact that, after\nsaying that in this matter there is absolutely nothing improper,\nyou have immediately subjoined: \u201cBe this, however, as it may, I\nbeg you to do me this kindness, for I am on the point of embarking\non a voyage\u201d? For this intimates that in your view, at least,\nthere is no impropriety in your request, but that whatever\nimpro","priety may be in\nit, you nevertheless ask me to do what you ask, because you are\nabout to go on a voyage. Now what is the force of this\nsupplementary plea\u2014\u201cI am on the point of embarking on a\nvoyage\u201d? Do you mean that, unless you were in these\ncircumstances, I ought not to do you service in which anything\nimproper may be involved? You think, forsooth, that the impropriety\ncan be washed away by salt water.

But when the mind perceives\nitself to be mutable,\u2014a fact which may be learned from this, even\nthough nothing else proved it, that the mind from being foolish may\nbe made wise,\u2014and apprehends that wisdom is unchangeable, it must\nat the same time apprehend that wisdom is superior to its own\nnature, and that it finds more abundant and abiding joy in the\ncommunications and light of wisdom than in itself. Thus desisting\nand subsiding from boasting and self-conceit, it strives to cling\nto God, and to be recruited and reformed by Him who is\nunchangeable; whom it now understands to be the Author not only of\nevery species of all things with which it comes in contact, either\nby the bodily senses or by intellectual faculties, but also of even\nthe very capacity of taking form before any form has been taken,\nsince the formless is defined to ","be that which can receive a form.\nTherefore it feels its own instability more, just in proportion as\nit clings less to God, whose being is perfect: it discerns also\nthat the perfection of His being is consummate because He is\nimmutable, and therefore neither gains nor loses, but that in\nitself every change by which it gains capacity for perfect clinging\nto God is advantageous, but every change by which it loses is\npernicious, and further, that all loss tends towards destruction;\nand although it is not manifest whether any thing is ultimately\ndestroyed, it is manifest to every one that the loss brings\ndestruction so far that the object no longer is what it was. Whence\nthe mind infers that the one reason why things suffer loss, or are\nliable to suffer loss, is, that they were made out of nothing; so\nthat their property of being, and of permanence, and the\narrangement whereby each finds even according to its imperfections\nits own place in the complex whole, all depend on the goodness and\nomnipotence of Him whose being is perfect,",{"tag":"note","id":"vii.1.CXVIII-p24.1"}," and who is the Creator able to\nmake out of nothing not only something, but something great; and\nthat the first sin, ",[{"notes":[],"contents":"i.e."}]," the first voluntary loss, is\nrejoicing in its own power: for it rejoices in something less than\nwould be the source of its joy if it rejoiced in the power of God,\nwhich is unquestionably greater.

Epicurus, however, does not assume anything\nin the first beginnings of things but atoms, that is, certain\ncorpuscles, so minute that they cannot be divided or perceived\neither by sight or by touch; and his doctrine is, that by the\nfortuitous concourse (clashing) of these atoms, existence is given\nboth to innumerable worlds and to living things, and to the souls\nwhich animate them, and to the gods whom, in human form, he has\nlocated, not in any world, but outside of the worlds, and in the\nspaces which separate them; and he will not allow of any object of\nthought beyond things material. But in order to these becoming an\nobject of thought, he says that from those things which he\nrepresents as formed of atoms, images more subtle than those which\ncome to our eyes flow down and enter into the mind. For according\nto him, the cause of our seeing is to be found in certain images so\nhuge that they embrace the whole outer world. But I suppose that\nyou already understand their opinions regarding these images."]},{"notes":[],"contents":["29.

For when a small body is brought into\ncontact with a large one, it cannot in any wise be touched at the\nsame moment by all points of the larger. How, then, are these\nimages at the same moment in their whole extent objects of thought,\nif they become objects of thought only in so far as, coming and\nentering into the mind, they touch it, seeing that they cannot in\ntheir whole extent either find entrance into so small a body or\ncome in contact with so small a mind? Bear in mind, of course, that\nI am speaking now after their manner; for I do not hold the mind to\nbe such as they affirm. It is true that Epicurus alone can be\nassailed with this argument, if Democritus holds that the mind is\nimmaterial; but we may ask him in turn why he did not perceive that\nit is at once unnecessary and impossible for the mind, being\nimmaterial, to think through the approach and contact of material\n","images.

Nay, more;\nwe are not at liberty even to grant the existence of atoms\nthemselves, for, without discussing the subtle theories of the\nlearned as to the divisibility of matter, observe how easily the\nabsurdity of atoms may be proved from their own opinions.

For the opinion of these philosophers is, that these\nimages can proceed from the material object and come to the eyes or\nto the mind, which, nevertheless, they affirm to be material. Now,\nI ask, do these images flow from atoms themselves? If they do, how\ncan these be atoms from which some bodily particles are in this\nprocess separated? If they do not, either something can be the\nobject of thought without such images, which they vehemently deny,\nor we ask, whence have they acquired a knowledge of atoms, seeing\nthat they can in nowise become objects of thought to us?

It becomes us,\nmoreover, to yield submission to His authority all the more\nunreservedly, when we see that in our day no error dares to lift up\nitself to rally round it the uninstructed crowd without seeking the\nshelter of the Christian name, and that of all who, belonging to an\nearlier age, now remain outside of the Christian name, those alone\ncontinue to have in their obscure assemblies a considerable\nattendance who retain the Scriptures by which, however they may\npretend not to see or understand it, the Lord Jesus Christ Himself\nwas prophetically announced. Moreover, those who, though they are\nnot within the Catholic unity and communion, boast of the name of\nChristians, are compelled to oppose them that believe, and presume\nto mislead the ignorant by a pretence of appealing to reason, since\nthe Lord came with this remedy above all others, that He enjoined\non the nations the duty of faith. But they are compelled, as I have\nsaid, to adopt this policy because they feel themselves most\nmiserably overthrown if their authority is compared with the\nCatholic authority. They attempt, accordingly, to prevail against\nthe firmly-settled authority of the immoveable Church by the name\nand the promises of a pretended appeal to reason. This kind of\neffrontery is, we may say, characteristic of all heretics.

I by no means dispute the perfect correctness of\nthe maxim, that good faith requires an oath to be kept, not\naccording to the mere words of him who gives it, but according to\nthat which the person giving the oath knows to be the expectation\nof the person to whom he swears. For it is very difficult to define\nin words, especially in few words, the promise in regard to which\nsecurity is exacted from him who gives his oath. They, therefore,\nare guilty of perjury, who, while adhering to the letter of their\npromise, disappoint the known expectation of those to whom their\noath was given; and they are not guilty of perjury, who, even\nthough departing from the letter of the promise, fulfil that which\nwas expected of them when they gave their oath. Wherefore, seeing\nthat the people of Hippo desired to have the holy Pinianus, not as\na prisoner who had forfeited liberty, but as a much-loved resident\nin their town, the limits of that which they expected from him,\nthough it could not be adequately embraced in the words of his\npromise, are nevertheless so obvious that the fact of his being at\nthis moment absent, after giving his oath to remain among them,\ndoes not disturb any one who may have heard that he was to leave\nthis place for a definite purpose, and with the intention of\nreturning. Accordingly, he will not be guilty of perjury, nor will\nhe be regarded by them as violating his oath, unless he disappoint\ntheir expectation; and he will not disappoint their expectation,\nunless he either abandon his purpose of residing among them, or at\nsome future time depart from them without intending to return. May\nGod forbid that he should so depart from the holiness and fidelity\nwhich he owes to Christ and to the Church! For, not to speak of the\ndread judgment of God upon perjurers, which you know as well as\nmyself, I am perfectly certain that henceforth we shall have no\nright to be displeased with any one who may refuse to believe what\nwe attest by an oath, if we are found to think that perjury in such\na man as Pinianus is to be not only tolerated without indignation,\nbut actually defended.

To all to whom I could address myself, namely, to\nthe more venerable and aged men who had come up to me in the apse,\nI stated that I could not be moved to break my word, and that in\nthe church committed to my care he could not be ordained by any\nother bishop except with my consent asked and obtained, in granting\nwhich I should be no less guilty of a breach of faith.

It\nis true that the fears of danger were, as we afterwards\nascertained, without foundation; but whatever the danger might be,\nit was shared by us all alike. The fear was also shared by all; and\nI myself had thoughts of retiring, being alarmed chiefly for the\nsafety of the building in which we were assembled.

In the midst of this excitement and great\ndistress, when, being at our wit\u2019s end, we could not, so to\nspeak, take breath, behold our pious son Pinianus, suddenly and\nquite unexpectedly, sends to me a servant of God, to tell me that\nhe wished to swear to the people, that if he were ordained against\nhis will he would leave Africa altogether, thinking, I believe,\nthat the people, knowing that of course he could not violate his\noath, would not continue their outcry, seeing that by perseverance\nthey could gain nothing, but only drive from among us a man whom we\nought at least to retain as a neighbour, if he was to be no more.\nAs it seemed to me, however, that it was to be feared that the\nvehemence of the people\u2019s grief would be increased by his ","taking an oath of this kind,\nI was silent in regard to it; and as he had by the same messenger\nbegged me to come to him, I went without delay.

On this, being comforted in\nmy perplexities as by a breath of air when in danger of\nsuffocation, I made no reply, but went with quickened pace to my\nbrother Alypius, and told him what Pinianus had said. But he, being\ncareful, I suppose, lest anything should be done with his sanction\nby which he thought you might be offended, said, \u201cLet no one ask\nmy opinion on this subject.\u201d Having heard this, I hastened to the\nnoisy crowd, and having obtained silence, declared to them what had\nbeen promised, along with the proffered guarantee of an oath. The\npeople, however, having no other thought or desire than that he\nshould be their presbyter, did not receive the proposal as I had\nexpected they would, but, after talking in an under-tone among\nthemselves, made the request that to this promise and oath a clause\nmight be added, that if at any time he should be pleased to consent\nto accept the clerical office, he should do so in no other church\nthan that of Hippo.

The holy Melania wished to add also, as a possible\nreason for departure, the unhealthiness of the climate; but she was\nkept from this by his reply. I said, however, that he had brought\nforward an important reason deserving consideration, and one which,\nif it occurred, would compel the citizens themselves to abandon the\nplace; but that, if this reason were stated to the people, we might\njustly fear lest they should regard us as prophesying evil, and, on\nthe other hand, if a pretext for withdrawing from the promise were\nput under the general name of necessity, it might be thought that\nthe necessity was only covering an intention to deceive. It seemed\ngood to him, therefore, that we should test the feeling of the\npeople in regard to this, and we found the result exactly as I had\nexpected. For when the words which he had dictated were read by the\ndeacon, and had been received with approbation, as soon as the\nclause concerning necessity which might hinder the fulfilment of\nhis promise fell upon their ears, there arose at once a shout of\nremonstrance, and the promise was rejected; and the tumult began to\nbreak out again, the people thinking that these negotiations had no\nother object than to deceive them.

For I am\naware that I passed over some things which seemed to me irrelevant,\nbut I know that I said nothing but the truth. It is therefore true\nthat our holy son Pinianus took his oath in my presence and with my\npermission, but it is not true that he did it in obedience to any\ncommand from me. He himself knows this: it is also known to those\nservants of God whom he sent to me, the first being the pious\nBarnabas, the second Timasius, by whom also he sent me the promise\nof his remaining in Hippo. As for the people themselves, moreover,\nthey were urging him by their cries to accept the office of\npresbyter.

And therefore they also were actuated in\ntheir clamorous procedure by regard to God\u2019s work (for surely the\nconsecration of a presbyter is a work of God); and inasmuch as they\ndid not feel satisfied with his promise of remaining in Hippo,\nunless it were also promised that, in the event of his at any time\naccepting the clerical office, he should do it nowhere else than\namong them, it is perfectly manifest what they hoped for from his\ndwelling among them, and that they did not abandon their zeal for\nthe work of God."]},{"notes":[],"contents":["7. On what ground, then, do you allege that the\npeople did this out of a base desire for money? In the first place,\nthe people who were so clamorous have nothing whatever of this kind\nto gain; for as the people of Thagaste derive from the gifts which\nyou have bestowed on their church no profit but the joy of seeing\nyour good work, it will be the same in the case of the people of\nHippo, or of any other place in which you have obeyed or may yet\nobey the law of your Lord concerning the \u201cmammon of\nunrighteousness.\u201d The people, therefore, in most vehemently\ninsisting upon guiding the procedure of their church in regard to\nso great a man, did not ask from you a pecuniary advantage, but\ntestified their admiration for your contempt of money. For if in my\nown case, because they had heard that, despising my patrimony,\nwhich consisted of only a few small fields, I had consecrated\nmyself to the liberty of serving God, they loved this\ndisinterestedness, and did not grudge this gift to the church of my\nbirthplace, Thagaste, but, when it had not imposed upon me the\nclerical office, made me by force, so to speak, their own, how much\nmore ardently might they love in our Pinianus his overcoming and\ntreading under foot with such remarkable decision riches so great\nand hopes so bright, and a strong natural capacity for enjoying\nthis world! I indeed seem, in the opinion of many, who compare\nthemselves with themselves, to have rather found than forsaken\nwealth. For my patrimony can scarcely be considered a twentieth\npart of the ecclesiastical property which I am now supposed to\npossess as master. But in whatever church, especially in Africa,\nour Pinianus might be ordained (I do not say a presbyter, but) a\nbishop, he would be still in deep poverty compared with his former\naffluence, even if he were using the church\u2019s revenues in the\nspirit of one lording it over God\u2019s heritage. Christian poverty\nis much more clearly and certainly loved in the case of one in whom\nthere is no room for suspecting a desire for acquiring an accession\nto his wealth. It was this admiration which kindled the minds of\nthe people, and roused them to such violence of persevering\nclamour. Let us therefore not charge them gratuitously with base\ncovetousness, but rather, without imputing unworthy motives, allow\nthem at least to love in others that good thing which they do not\nthemselves possess. For although there may have mixed in the crowd\nsome who are indigent or beggars, who helped to increase the\nclamour, and were actuated by the hope of some relief to their\nwants out of your honourable affluence, even this is not, in my\nopinion, base covetousness."]},{"notes":[],"contents":["8.

Do you think that even if\ndeath, which in this case was feared without reason, were certainly\nimminent, a Christian might use the name of his Lord to confirm a\nlie, and call his God to be witness to a falsehood? For assuredly a\nChristian, if urged by the menace of instant death to perjure\nhimself by false testimony, ought to fear the loss of honour more\nthan the loss of life. Hostile armies confront each other in the\nbattle-field with mutual menaces of death, about which there can be\nno uncertainty; and yet, when they pledge themselves to each other\nby oath, we praise those who are faithful to their engagement, and\nwe justly abhor those who are unfaithful. Now what was the motive\nleading them to swear to each other, but the fear on both sides of\nbeing killed or taken prisoners? And by this promise even such men\nhold themselves bound, lest they be guilty of sacrilege and perjury\nif they did not fulfil the oath extorted by the fear of death or\ncaptivity, and broke the promise given in such circumstances: they\nare more afraid of breaking their oath than of taking a man\u2019s\nlife. And do we propose to discuss as a debatable question whether\nan oath must be fulfilled which has been given under fear of harm\nby servants of God, who are under pre-eminent obligations to\nholi","ness, by monks who\nare running the race towards Christian perfection, by distributing\ntheir property according to Christ\u2019s command?"]},{"notes":[],"contents":["12. Tell me, I beseech you, what hardship deserving\nthe name of exile, or transportation, or banishment, is involved in\nhis promise to reside here? I suppose that the office of presbyter\nis not exile. Would our Pinianus prefer exile to that office? Far\nbe it from us to find such apology for one who is a saint of God\nand very dear to us: God forbid, I say, that it should be said of\nhim that he preferred exile to the office of presbyter, and\npreferred to perjure himself rather than submit to exile. This I\nwould say even if it were true that the oath by which he promised\nto reside among us had been extorted from him but the fact is that,\ninstead of being extorted in spite of his refusal, it was accepted\nwhen he had proffered it himself. It was accepted, moreover, as I\nhave already said, because of the hope, which was encouraged by his\nremaining here, that he might also consent to comply with our\ndesire that he should accept the clerical office. In fine, whatever\nopinion may be entertained concerning us or concerning the people\nof Hippo, the case of those who may have compelled him to take the\noath is very different from that of those who may have\u2014I do not\nsay compelled, but at least\u2014counselled him to break the oath.

For if they were to exact literal fulfilment of the words of\nthe promise, it would be the duty of a servant of God to adhere to\nevery sentence of it rather than forswear himself. But as it would\nbe a crime for them so to bind any one, much more such a man as he\nis, so they have themselves proved that they had no such\nunreasonable expectation; for on hearing that he had gone away with\nthe intention of returning, they expressed their satisfaction; and\nfidelity to an oath requires no more than the performance of what\nwas expected by those to whom it was given. Let me ask, moreover,\nwhat is meant by saying that he, in giving the oath with his own\nlips, mentioned the possibility of necessity preventing his\nfulfilment of the promise? The truth is, that with his own lips he\nordered the qualifying clause to be removed. If he put it in, it\nwould be when he himself spoke to the people; but if he had done\nso, they assuredly would not have answered, \u201cThanks be unto\nGod,\u201d but would have renewed the protestations which they made\nwhen it was read with the qualifying clause by the deacon. And what\ndifference does it really make whether this plea of necessity for\ndeparting from the promise was or was not inserted? Nothing more\nthan we have stated above was expected from him; but he who\ndisappoints the known expectation of those to whom his oath is\ngiven, cannot but be a perjured person."]},{"notes":[],"contents":["14.

Let us especially guard against giving occasion in this to\nthe tongues of enemies, which are used by the great Enemy as darts\nwherewith to slay the weak. But God forbid that we should expect\nfrom a man like Pinianus anything else than what the fear of God\ninspires, and the superior excellence of his own piety approves. As\nfor myself, whom you blame for not interfering to forbid his oath,\nI admit that I could not bring myself to believe that, in\ncircumstances so disorderly and scandalous, I ought rather to allow\nthe church which I serve to be overthrown, than accept the\ndeliverance which was offered to us by such a man."]}]},{"title":"To Proba","node-type":"section","sub-title":"Letter CXXX","id":"vii.1.CXXX","type":"Letter","shorttitle":"Letter CXXX","number":"CXXX","children":[{"notes":[],"contents":[["Letter CXXX."]]},{"notes":[],"contents":["(",["a.d."]," 412.)"]},{"notes":[{"tag":"note","attrs":{"place":"end","n":"2420","id":"vii.1.CXXX-p3.2","anchored":"yes"},"content":[{"tag":"p","attrs":{"shownumber":"no","id":"vii.1.CXXX-p4","class":"endnote"},"content":[" Anicia Faltonia Proba, the widow of Sextus\nPetronius Probus, belonged to a Roman family of great wealth and\nnoble lineage.

There are five distinct bodily senses, which cannot\nexist either without the body or without the soul; because\nperception by the senses is possible, on the one hand, only while a\nman lives, and the body receives life from the soul; and on the\nother hand, only by the instrumentality of the body vessels and\norgans, through which we exercise sight, hearing, and the three\nother senses. Let the reasoning soul concentrate attention upon\nthis subject, and consider the senses of the body not by these\nsenses themselves, but by its own intelligence and reason. A man\ncannot, of course, perceive by these senses unless he lives; but up\nto the time when soul and body are separated by death, he lives in\nthe body. How, then, does his soul, which lives nowhere else than in\nhis body, perceive things which are beyond the surface of that\nbody? Are not the stars in heaven very remote from his body? and\nyet does he not see the sun yonder? and is not seeing an exercise\nof the bodily senses\u2014nay, is it not the noblest of them all?\nWhat, then? Does he live in heaven as well as in his body, because\nhe perceives by one of his senses what is in heaven, and perception\nby sense cannot be in a place where there is no life of the person\nperceiving? Or does he perceive even where he is not\nliving\u2014because while he lives only in his own body, his\nperceptive sense is active also in those places which, outside of\nhis body and remote from it, contain the objects with which he is\nin contact by sight? Do you see how great a mystery there is even\nin a sense so open to our observation as that which we call sight?\nConsider hearing also, and say whether the soul diffuses itself in\nsome way abroad beyond the body. For how do we say, \u201cSome one\nknocks at the door,\u201d unless we exercise the sense of hearing at\nthe place where the knock is sounding? In this case also,\ntherefore, we live beyond the limits of our bodies. Or can we\nperceive by sense in a place in which we are not living? But we\nknow that sense cannot be in exercise where life is not."]},{"notes":[],"contents":["6. The other three senses are exercised through\nimmediate contact with their own organs. Perhaps this may be\nreasonably disputed in regard to the sense of smell; but there is\nno controversy as to the senses of taste and touch, that we\nperceive nowhere else than by contact with our bodily organism the\nthings which we taste and touch. Let these three senses, therefore,\nbe set aside from present consideration. The senses of sight and\nhearing present to us a wonderful question, requiring us to explain\neither how the soul can perceive by these senses in a place where\nit does not live, or how it can live in a place where it is not.\nFor it is not anywhere but in its own body, and yet it perceives by\nthese senses in places beyond that body. For in whatever place the\nsoul sees anything, in that place it is exercising the faculty of\nperception, because seeing is an act of perception; and in whatever\nplace the soul hears anything, in that place it is exercising the\nfaculty of perception, because hearing is an act of perception.\nWherefore the soul is either living in that place where it sees or\nhears, and consequently is itself in that place, or it exercises\nperception in a place where it is not living, or it is living in a\nplace and yet at the same moment is not there. All these things are\nastonishing; not one of them can be stated without seeming\nabsurdity; and we are speaking only of senses which are mortal.\nWhat, then, is the soul itself which is beyond the bodily senses,\nthat is to say, which resides in the understanding whereby it\nconsiders these mysteries? For it is not by means of the senses\nthat it forms a judgment concerning the senses themselves. And do\nwe suppose that something incredible is told us regarding the\nomnipotence of God, when it is affirmed that the Word of God, by\nwhom all things were made, did so assume a body from the Virgin,\nand manifest Himself with mortal senses, as neither to destroy His\nown immortality, nor to change His eternity, nor to diminish His\npower, nor to relinquish the government of the world, nor to\nwithdraw from the bosom of the Father, that is, from the secret\nplace where He is with Him and in Him?"]},{"notes":[],"contents":["7.

Some resist upon being furnished with an\nexplanation of the manner in which the Godhead was so united with a\nhuman soul and body as to constitute the one person of Christ, when\nit was necessary that this should be done once in the world\u2019s\nhistory, with as much boldness as if they were themselves able to\nfurnish an explanation of the manner in which the soul is so united\nto the body as to constitute the one person of man, an event which\nis occurring every day. For just as the soul is united to the body\nin one person so as to constitute man, in the same way God united\nto man in one person so as to constitute Christ. In the former\npersonality there is a combination of soul and body; in the latter\nthere is a combination of the Godhead and man. Let my reader,\nhowever, guard against borrowing his idea of the combination from\nthe properties of material bodies, by which two fluids when\ncombined are so mixed that neither preserves its original\ncharacter; although even among material bodies there are\nexceptions, such as light, which sustains no change when combined\nwith the atmosphere. In the person of man, therefore, there is a\ncombination of soul and body; in the person of Christ there is a\ncombination of the Godhead with man; for when the Word of God was\nunited to a soul having a body, He took into union with Himself\nboth the soul and the body. The former event takes place daily in\nthe beginning of life in individuals of the human race; the latter\ntook place once for the salvation of men. And yet of the two\nevents, the combination of two immaterial substances ought to be\nmore easily believed than a combination in which the one is\nimmaterial and the other material. For if the soul is not mistaken\nin regard to its own nature, it understands itself to be\nimmaterial. Much more certainly does this attribute belong to the\nWord of God; and consequently the combination of the Word with the\nhuman soul is a combination which ought to be much more credible\nthan that of soul and body. The latter is realized by us in\nourselves; the former we are commanded to believe to have been\nrealized in Christ. But if both of them were alike foreign to our\nexperience, and we were enjoined to believe that both had taken\nplace, which of the two would we more readily believe to have\noccurred? Would we not admit that two immaterial substances could\nbe more easily combined than one immaterial and one material;\nunless, perhaps, it be unsuitable to use the word combination in\nconnection with these things, because of the difference between\ntheir nature and that of material substances, both in themselves\nand as known to us?"]},{"notes":[{"tag":"note","attrs":{"place":"end","n":"2523","id":"vii.1.CXXXVII-p27.1","anchored":"yes"},"content":[{"tag":"p","attrs":{"shownumber":"no","id":"vii.1.CXXXVII-p28","class":"endnote"},"content":[{"tag":"scripRef","attrs":{"passage":"1 Cor. 1.24","parsed":"|1Cor|1|24|0|0","osisRef":"Bible:1Cor.1.24","id":"vii.1.CXXXVII-p28.1"},"content":["1 Cor. i. 24"]},"."]}]},{"tag":"note","attrs":{"place":"end","n":"2524","id":"vii.1.CXXXVII-p28.2","anchored":"yes"},"content":[{"tag":"p","attrs":{"shownumber":"no","id":"vii.1.CXXXVII-p29","class":"endnote"},"content":[{"tag":"scripRef","attrs":{"passage":"Wisd. 8.1","parsed":"|Wis|8|1|0|0","osisRef":"Bible:Wis.8.1","id":"vii.1.CXXXVII-p29.1"},"content":["Wisd. viii. 1"]},"."]}]},{"tag":"note","attrs":{"place":"end","n":"2525","id":"vii.1.CXXXVII-p29.2","anchored":"yes"},"content":[{"tag":"p","attrs":{"shownumber":"no","id":"vii.1.CXXXVII-p30","class":"endnote"},"content":[{"tag":"scripRef","attrs":{"passage":"1 Tim. 2.5","parsed":"|1Tim|2|5|0|0","osisRef":"Bible:1Tim.2.5","id":"vii.1.CXXXVII-p30.1"},"content":["1 Tim. ii. 5"]},"."]}]}],"contents":["12.

In the text thus brought forward as a proof, statements are\nmade concerning both, as if the manner of the return of each to its\noriginal was precisely similar in both,\u2014the body, on the one\nhand, returning to the earth as it was, for thence was it taken\nwhen the first man was formed; the soul, on the other hand,\nreturning to God, for He gave it when He breathed into the nostrils\nof the man whom He had formed the breath of life, and he became a\nliving soul,",{"tag":"note","id":"vii.1.CXLIII-p21.2"}," so that\nthenceforward the propagation of each part should go on from the\ncorresponding part in the parent."]},{"notes":[],"contents":["9. If, however, the true account of the soul\u2019s\norigin be, that God gives to each individual man a soul, not\npropagated from that first soul, but created in some other way, the\nstatement that the \u201cspirit returns to God who gave it,\u201d is\nequally consistent with this view. The two other opinions regarding\nthe soul\u2019s origin are, then, the only ones which seem to be\nexcluded by this text. For in the first place, as to the opinion\nthat every man\u2019s soul is made separately within him at the time\nof his creation, it is supposed that, if this were the case, the\nsoul should have been spoken of as returning, not to God who gave\nit, but to God who made it; for the word \u201cgave\u201d seems to imply\nthat that which could be given had already a separate existence.\nThe words \u201creturneth to God\u201d are further insisted upon by some,\nwho say, How could it return to a place where it had never been\nbefore? Accordingly they maintain that, if the soul is to be\nbelieved to have never been with God before, the words should have\nbeen \u201cit goes,\u201d or \u201cgoes on,\u201d or \u201cgoes away,\u201d rather\nthan it \u201creturns\u201d to God. In like manner, as to the opinion\nthat each soul glides of its own accord into its body, it is not\neasy to explain how this theory is reconcilable with the statement\nthat God gave it. The words of this scriptural passage are\nconsequently somewhat adverse to these two opinions, namely, the\none which supposes each soul to be created in its own body, and the\none which supposes each soul to introduce itself into its own body\nspontaneously. But there is no difficulty in showing that the words\nare consistent with either of the other two opinions, namely, that\nall souls are derived by propagation from the one first created, or\nthat, having been created and kept in readiness with God, they are\ngiven to each body as required."]},{"notes":[{"tag":"note","attrs":{"place":"end","n":"2580","id":"vii.1.CXLIII-p24.1","anchored":"yes"},"content":[{"tag":"p","attrs":{"shownumber":"no","id":"vii.1.CXLIII-p25","class":"endnote"},"content":[{"tag":"scripRef","attrs":{"passage":"Rom. 1.24","parsed":"|Rom|1|24|0|0","osisRef":"Bible:Rom.1.24","id":"vii.1.CXLIII-p25.1"},"content":["Rom. i. 24"]},"."]}]}],"contents":["10.

The same considerations which made me then depart\nwould have been the cause of my remaining silent to you, if I\nbelieved you to have used your influence with him to avenge such\nwicked injuries. This is believed in regard to you only by those\nwho do not know how, and how frequently, and in what terms, you\nexpressed your mind to us, when we were with anxious solicitude\ndoing our utmost to secure that, because he was so intimate with\nyou, and you were so constantly visiting him, and so often\nconversing alone with him, he should all the more carefully guard\nyour good name, and save you from being supposed to have used no\nendeavour to prevent him from inflicting that mode of death on\npersons said to be your enemies. This, indeed, is not believed of\nyou by me, nor by my brethren who heard you in conversation, and\nwho saw, both in your words and in every gesture, the evidences of\nyour heart\u2019s good-will to those who were put to death. But, I\nbeseech you, forgive those by whom it is believed; for they are\nmen, and in the minds of men there are such lurking places and such\ndepths that, although all suspicious persons deserved to be blamed,\nthey think themselves that they even deserve praise for their\nprudence. There existed reasons for the conduct imputed to you: we\nknew that you had suffered very grievous injury from one of those\nwhom he had suddenly ordered to be arrested. His brother, also, in\nwhose person especially he persecuted the Church, was said to have\nanswered you in terms implying as it were some harsh accusation.\nBoth were thought to be looked upon by you with suspicion. When\nthey, after being summoned, had gone away, you still remained in\nthe place, and were engaged, it was ","said, in conversation of a more private kind\nthan usual with him [Marinas], and then they were suddenly ordered\nto be detained. Men talked much of your friendship with him as not\nrecent, but of long standing. The closeness of your intimacy, and\nthe frequency of your private conversations with him, confirmed\nthis report. His power was at that time great. The ease with which\nfalse accusations could be made against any one was notorious. It\nwas not a difficult thing to find some person who would upon the\npromise of his own safety make any statements which he might order\nto be made. All things at that time made it easy for any man to be\nbrought to death without any examination on the part of him who\nordered the execution, if even one witness brought forward what\nseemed to be an odious and, at the same time, credible\naccusation."]},{"notes":[],"contents":["5. Meanwhile, as it was rumored that the power of\nthe Church might deliver them, we were mocked with false promises,\nso that not only with the consent, but, as it seemed, at the urgent\ndesire of Marinus, a bishop was sent to the Imperial Court to\nintercede for them, the promise having been brought to the ear of\nthe bishops that, until some pleading should be heard there on\nbehalf of the prisoners, no examination of their case would be\nproceeded with. At last, on the day before they were put to death,\nyour Excellency came to us; you gave us encouragement such as you\nhad never before given, that he might grant their lives as a favour\nto you before your departure [for Rome], because you had solemnly\nand prudently said to him that all his condescension in admitting\nyou so constantly to familiar and private conversation would bring\nto you disgrace rather than distinction, and would have the effect,\nafter the death of these men had been a subject of conversation and\nconsultation between you, of making every one say that there could\nbe no doubt what was to be the issue of these conferences. When you\ninformed us that you had said these things to him, you stretched\nout your hand as you spoke towards the place at which the\nsacraments of believers are celebrated, and while we listened in\namazement, you confirmed the statement that you had used these\nwords with an oath so solemn, that not only then, but even now\nafter the dreadful and unexpected death of the prisoners, it seems\nto me, recalling to memory your whole demeanour, that it would be\nan aggravated insult if I were to believe any evil concerning you.\nYou said, moreover, that he was so moved by these words of yours,\nthat he purposed to give the lives of these men to you as a\npresent, in token of friendship, before you set out on your\njourney."]},{"notes":[],"contents":["6.

For care\nhad been taken to arrange, as the scene of execution, a place\nimmediately adjoining, not appointed for the punishment of\ncriminals, but used for the recreation of the citizens, on which\nspot he had ordered some to be executed a few days previously, with\nthe design (as is with good reason believed) of avoiding the odium\nof applying it to this purpose for the first time in the case of\nthese men, whom he hoped to be able to snatch secretly from the\nChurch interposing on their behalf, by thus not only ordering their\nimmediate execution, but also ordering it to take place on the\nnearest available spot.

Forasmuch, therefore, as God would in no wise\nforsake a man so merciful in his disposition and conduct, there\nappeared to him in sleep a youth of remarkable appearance and\ncommanding presence, who said to him: \u201cFollow me.\u201d Following\nhim, he came to a city where he began to hear on the right hand\nsounds of a melody so exquisitely sweet as to surpass anything he\nhad ever heard. When he inquired what it was, his guide said: \u201cIt\nis the hymn of the blessed and the holy.\u201d What he reported\nhimself to have seen on the left hand escapes my remembrance.

Thereupon he asked Gennadius where he had become\nacquainted with him. There also his memory failed him not as to the\nproper reply: he narrated the whole vision, and the hymns of the\nsaints which, under his guidance, he had been taken to hear, with\nall the readiness natural to recollection of some very recent\nexperience. On this the youth inquired whether it was in sleep or\nwhen awake that he had seen what he had just narrated. Gennadius\nanswered: \u201cIn sleep.\u201d The youth then said: \u201cYou remember it\nwell; it is true that you saw these things in sleep, but I would\nhave you know that even now you are seeing in sleep.\u201d Hearing\nthis, Gennadius was persuaded of its truth, and in his reply\ndeclared that he believed it.

That which is liable\nto be changed in any manner, by any cause, or in any part whatever,\nis therefore not by nature immutable; but it were impiety to think\nof God as otherwise than truly and supremely immutable: therefore\nthe soul is not a part of God."]},{"notes":[],"contents":["4. That the soul is immaterial is a fact of which I\navow myself to be fully persuaded, although men of slow\nunderstanding are hard to be convinced that it is so. To secure\nmyself, however, from either unnecessarily causing to others or\nunreasonably bringing upon myself a controversy about an\nexpression, let me say that, since the thing itself is beyond\nquestion, it is needless to contend about mere terms. If matter be\nused as a term denoting everything which in any form has a separate\nexistence, whether it be called an essence, or a substance, or by\nanother name, the soul is material. Again, if you choose to apply\nthe epithet immaterial only to that nature which is supremely\nimmutable and is everywhere present in its entirety, the soul is\nmaterial, for it is not at all endowed with such qualities. But if\nmatter be used to designate nothing but that which, whether at rest\nor in motion, has some length, breadth, and height, so that with a\ngreater part of itself it occupies a greater part of space, and\nwith a smaller part a smaller space, and is in every part of it\nless than the whole, then the soul is not material. For it pervades\nthe whole body which it animates, not by a local distribution of\nparts, but by a certain vital influence, being at the same moment\npresent in its entirety in all parts of the body, and not less in\nsmaller parts and greater in larger parts, but here with more\nenergy and there with less energy, it is in its entirety present\nboth in the whole body and in every part of it. For even that which\nthe mind perceives in only a part of the body is nevertheless not\notherwise perceived than by the whole mind; for when any part of\nthe living flesh is touched by a fine pointed instrument, although\nthe place affected is not only not the whole body, but scarcely\ndiscernible in its surface, the contact does not escape the entire\nmind, and yet the contact is felt not over the whole body, but only\nat the one point where it takes place. How comes it, then, that\nwhat takes place in only a part of the body is immediately known to\nthe whole mind, unless the whole mind is present at that part, and\nat the same time not deserting all the other parts of the body in\norder to be present in its entirety at this one? For all the other\nparts of the body in which no such contact takes place are still\nliving by the soul being present with them. And if a similar\ncontact takes place in the other parts, and the contact occur in\nboth parts simultaneously, it would in both cases alike be known at\nthe same moment, to the whole mind. Now this presence of the mind\nin all parts of the body at the same moment, so that in every part\nof the body the whole mind is at the same moment present, would be\nimpossible if it were distributed over these parts in the same way\nas we see matter distributed in space, occupying less space with a\nsmaller portion of itself, and greater space with a greater\nportion. If, therefore, mind is to be called material, it is not\nmaterial in the same sense as earth, water, air, and ether are\nmaterial. For all things composed of these elements are larger in\nlarger places, or smaller in smaller places, and none of them is in\nits entirety present at any part of itself, but the dimensions of\nthe material substances are according to the dimensions of the\nspace occupied. Whence it is perceived that the soul, whether it be\ntermed material or immaterial, has a certain nature of its own,\ncreated from a substance superior to the elements of this\nworld,\u2014a substance which cannot be truly conceived of by any\nrepresentation of the material images perceived by the bodily\nsenses, but which is apprehended by the understanding and\ndiscovered to our consciousness by its living energy.

Moreover, if God\naccomplishes, in any measure, the correction of the parents when\nthey are chastised by the sufferings or by the death of the\nchildren that are dear to them, is there any reason why these\nthings should not take place, seeing that, after they are passed,\nthey will be, to those who experienced them, as if they had never\nbeen, while the persons on whose account they were inflicted will\neither become better, being moved by the rod of temporal\nafflictions to choose a better mode of life, or be left without\nexcuse under the punishment awarded at the coming judgment, if,\nnotwithstanding the sorrows of this life, they have refused to turn\ntheir desires towards eternal life?

Who knows what good\nrecompense God may, in the secret of his judgments, reserve for\nthese little ones? For although they have done no righteous action,\nnevertheless, being free from any transgression of their own, they\nhave suffered these trials.

For they\nthink that to \u201cdie in Adam\u201d means to suffer punishment in that\nflesh which is derived from Adam, from which condition of guilt the\ngrace of Christ, they say, delivers the young as well as the old.\nSo far, indeed, they teach what is right, and true, and excellent,\nwhen they say that the grace of Christ delivers the young as well\nas the old from the guilt of sins. But that souls sin in another\nearlier life, and that for their sins in that state of being they\nare cast down into bodies as prisons, I do not believe: I reject\nand protest against such an opinion. I do this, in the first place,\nbecause they affirm that this is accomplished by means of some\nincomprehensible revolutions, so that after I know not how many\ncycles the soul must return again to the same burden of corruptible\nflesh and to the endurance of punishment,\u2014than which opinion I do\nnot know that anything more horrible could be conceived. In the\nnext place, who is the righteous man gone from the earth about whom\nwe should not (if what they say is true) feel afraid lest, sinning\nin Abraham\u2019s bosom, he should be cast down into the flames which\ntormented the rich man in the parable?",{"tag":"note","id":"vii.1.CLXVI-p74.1"}," For why may the soul not sin after\nleaving the body, if it can sin before entering it?

As an\napt illustration of this remark let me quote an entertaining\nanecdote. A man had fallen into a well where the quantity of water\nwas sufficient to break his fall and save him from death, but not\ndeep enough to cover his mouth and deprive him of speech. Another\nman approached, and on seeing him cries out in surprise: \u201cHow did\nyou fall in here?\u201d He answers: \u201cI beseech you to plan how you\ncan get me out of this, rather than ask how I fell in.\u201d So, since\nwe admit and hold as an article of the Catholic faith, that the\nsoul of even a little infant requires to be delivered out of the\nguilt of sin, as out of a pit, by the grace of Christ, it is\nsufficient for the soul of such a one that we know the way in which\nit is saved, even though we should never know the way in which it\ncame into that wretched condition.

But why have I, as if forgetting to whom I\naddress myself, assumed the tone of a teacher in stating the\nquestion regarding which I wish to be instructed by you?\nNevertheless, as I had resolved to submit to your examination my\nopinion regarding the equality of sins (a subject involving a\nquestion closely bearing on the matter on which I was writing), let\nme now at last bring my statement to a conclusion. Even though it\nwere true that he who has one virtue has all virtues, and that he\nwho lacks one virtue has none, this would not involve the\nconsequence that all sins are equal; for although it is true that\nwhere there is no virtue there is nothing right, it by no means\nfollows that among bad actions one cannot be worse than another, or\nthat divergence from that which is right does not admit of degrees.\nI think, however, that it is more agreeable to truth and consistent\nwith the Holy Scriptures to say, that what is true of the members\nof the body is true of the different dispositions of the soul\n(which, though not seen occupying different places, are by their\ndistinctive workings perceived as plainly as the members of the\nbody), namely, that as in the same body one member is more fully\n","shone upon by the\nlight, another is less shone upon, and a third is altogether\nwithout light, and remains in the dark under some impervious\ncovering, something similar takes place in regard to the various\ndispositions of the soul.

Nor when\nit is given is it lost, but it is rather multiplied by giving it;\nfor in possessing it, not in parting with it, it is given. And\nsince it cannot be given unless it is possessed, so neither can it\nbe possessed unless it is given; nay, at the very time when it is\ngiven by a man it increases in that man, and, according to the\nnumber of persons to whom it is given, the amount of it which is\ngained becomes greater. Moreover, how can that be denied to friends\nwhich is due even to enemies? To enemies, however, this debt is\npaid with caution, whereas to friends it is repaid with confidence.\nNevertheless, it uses every effort to secure that it receives back\nwhat it gives, even in the case of those to whom it renders good\nfor evil.

But if he belong to the number of those of whom\nit is said, \u201cReprove not a scorner lest he hate thee,\u201d",{"tag":"note","id":"vii.1.CCX-p11.2"}," the\nquarrel does not arise from love on the part of the reproved, but\nit exercises and tests the love of the reprover; for he does not\nreturn hatred for hatred, but the love which constrains him to find\nfault endures unmoved, even when he who is found fault with\nrequites it with hatred. But if the reprover renders evil for evil\nto the man who takes offence at being reproved, he was not worthy\nto reprove another, but evidently deserves to be himself reproved.\nAct upon these principles, so that either quarrels may not arise,\nor, if they do arise, may quickly terminate in peace. Be more\nearnest to dwell in concord than to vanquish each other in\ncontroversy. For as vinegar corrodes a vessel if it remain long in\nit, so anger corrodes the heart if it is cherished till the morrow.\nThese things, therefore, observe, and the God of peace shall be\nwith you.

We all are mortal, and the day which\nshall be the last of life on earth is to every man at all times\nuncertain; but in infancy there is hope of entering on boyhood, and\nso our hope goes on, looking forward from boyhood to youth, from\nyouth to manhood, and from manhood to old age: whether these hopes\nmay be realized or not is uncertain, but there is in each case\nsomething which may be hoped for.

I went accordingly, and\nthe Lord was in mercy pleased so to help us that they harmoniously\naccepted as bishop the person designated by their former bishop his\nlifetime; for when this designation had become known to them, they\nwillingly acquiesced in the choice which he had made. An omission,\nhowever, had occurred by which some were dissatisfied; for brother\nSeverus, believing that it might be sufficient for him to mention\nto the clergy the name of his successor, did not speak of the\nmatter to the people, which gave rise to dissatisfaction in the\nminds of some. But why should I say more? By the good pleasure of\nGod, the dissatisfaction was removed, joy took its place in the\nminds of all, and he was ordained as bishop whom Severus had\nproposed.

And if it were in any\ncase impossible otherwise to terminate the debate, it appears to me\nthat the persons who are to remain and who are to flee should be\nchosen by lot. For those who say that they, in preference to\nothers, ought to flee, will appear to be chargeable either with\ncowardice, as persons unwilling to face impending danger, or with\narrogance, as esteeming their own lives more necessary to be\npreserved for the good of the Church than those of other men.\nAgain, perhaps, those who are better will be the first to choose to\nlay down their lives for the brethren; and so preservation by\nflight will be given to men whose life is less valuable because\ntheir skill in counselling and ruling the Church is less; yet\nthese, if they be pious and wise, will resist the desires of men in\nregard to whom they see, on the one hand, that it is more important\nfor the Church that they should live, and on the other hand, that\nthey would rather lose their lives than flee from danger. In this\ncase, as it is written, \u201cthe lot causeth contentions to cease,\nand parteth between the mighty;\u201d",{"tag":"note","id":"vii.1.CCXXVIII-p32.1"}," for, in difficulties of this kind,\nGod judges better than men, whether it please Him to call the\nbetter among His servants to the reward of suffering, and to spare\nthe weak, or to make the weak stronger to endure trials, and then\nto withdraw them from this life, as persons whose lives could not\nbe so serviceable to the Church as the lives of the others who are\nstronger than they. If such an appeal to the lot be made, it will\nbe, I admit, an unusual proceeding, but if it is done in any case,\nwho will dare to find fault with it? Who but the ignorant or the\nprejudiced will hesitate to praise with the approbation which it\ndeserves? If, however, the use of the lot is not adopted because\nthere is no precedent for such an appeal, let it by all means be\nsecured that the Church ","be not, through the flight of any one, left\ndestitute of that ministry which is more especially necessary and\ndue to her in the midst of such great dangers. Let no one hold\nhimself in such esteem because of apparent superiority in any grace\nas to say that he is more worthy of life than others, and therefore\nmore entitled to seek safety in flight.

There are some who think that bishops and clergy\nmay, by not fleeing but remaining in such dangers, cause the people\nto be misled, because, when they see those who are set over them\nremaining, this makes them not flee from danger. It is easy for\nthem, however, to obviate this objection, and the reproach of\nmisleading others, by addressing their congregations, and saying:\n\u201cLet not the fact that we are not fleeing from this place be the\noccasion of misleading you, for we remain here not for our own\nsakes but for yours, that we may continue to minister to you\nwhatever we know to be necessary to your salvation, which is in\nChrist; therefore, if you choose to flee, you thereby set us also\nat liberty from the obligations by which we are bound to remain.\u201d\nThis, I think, ought to be said, when it seems to be truly\nadvantageous to remove to places of greater security.
